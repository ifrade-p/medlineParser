The use of biological therapies, including infliximab (IFX), is one of the strategies to treat both CD and UC. The IFX treatment is monitored by complementary tests, namely: fecal calprotectin (FC); C-reactive protein (CRP); and endoscopic and cross-sectional imaging. Besides, serum IFX evaluation and antibody detection are also used. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trough levels (TL) and antibodies in a population with inflammatory bowel (IBD) disease undergoing treatment with IFX, and the factors that might impact the treatment effectiveness. METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional study with patients with IBD that were assessed for TL and antibody (ATI) levels in a southern Brazilian hospital, from June 2014 to July 2016. RESULTS: The study assessed 55 patients (52.7% female) submitted to serum IFX and antibody evaluations (95 blood samples, 55 first test; 30 second test, and 10 as third testing. Forty-five (47.3%) cases were diagnosed with CD (81.8%), and ten with UC (18.2%).

The treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy is quite challenging due to the particularity of elderly patients. This study intends to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and initial therapeutic effect of idiopathic membranous nephropathy among elderly patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of 67 elderly patients (58.2% male, median age 69.0\u2009years, range, 65-83\u2009years) with biopsy-proven membranous nephropathy was conducted at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital from 2016 to 2020. Data on clinicopathological characteristics and initial therapeutic effects were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients, the mean eGFR of overall patients was 66.49\u2009mL/min/1.73m(2) while the median urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) was 5676.73\u2009mg/g and 2951.56\u2009mg/g, respectively. Pathological data revealed that the membranous Churg's stage II was the most frequent (71.64%). Moreover, glomerular PLA2R antigen fluorescence intensity of (+) and IgG4 antigen fluorescence intensity of (++) were detected in 63.6% and 86.4% of all patients, respectively. Overall, 44 patients, accounting for 65.7%, achieved remission including complete remission and partial remission within 1\u2009year after renal biopsy. Compared with a non-remission group, the levels of uPCR (6274.6 vs. 3235.6\u2009mg/g, p\u2009=\u20090.007) and uACR (3433.6 vs. 1773.2\u2009mg/g, p\u2009=\u20090.017) were significantly higher in remission group. The proportion of immunosuppressive therapy in the remission group was also higher (86.4% vs. 30.4%, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Compared with conservative treatment, patients with combined treatment with glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide (CTX) or glucocorticoid and calcineurin inhibitor (CNIs) achieved higher remission rate (glucocorticoid plus cyclophosphamide vs. conservative treatment, 84.6% vs. 27.3%, p\u2009=\u20090.001; glucocorticoid plus calcineurin inhibitor vs. conservative treatment, 88.0% vs. 27.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Further analysis showed that compared with patients who underwent conservative treatment, the proportion of males, the levels of uPCR, uACR, BUN, Scr, CysC and PLA2R antigen-positive staining rate in kidney biopsy were higher in those who underwent combined treatment with glucocorticoid and CTX, while the levels of eGFR, TP and ALB were lower (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, patients who received combined treatment with glucocorticoid and CNIs had higher levels of uPCR, uACR, TC and lower levels of TP, ALB than those who received conservative treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences in the 1-year progression rate in eGFR between the immunosuppressive treatment group and conservative treatment group (3.3 vs. 0.2\u2009ml/min/1.73m(2), p\u2009=\u20090.852). CONCLUSIONS: Most elderly patients diagnosed with IMN had multiple comorbidities, and the membranous Churg's stage II was most common. The glomerular PLA2R and IgG4 antigen deposition were frequently detected accompanied by glomerulosclerosis and severe tubulointerstitial injury. For high-risk elderly patients with severe proteinuria, early initial immunosuppressive therapy could achieve a higher urinary protein remission rate.

Little is known about the characteristics of shift work nurses' sleep-wake features and their subsequent impact on work performance. The study aimed to describe the characteristics of the sleep-wake index, reaction time, saliva cortisol level, and fatigue severity among female shift work nurses. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional exploratory study. A convenience sample of 152 female nurses (8-hour day-evening-night, n\u2009=\u200970; 12-hour day-night, n\u2009=\u200982) participated in this study from nine intensive care units (ICUs) from two teaching hospitals in Beijing, China. A consecutive 7-day actigraphy data were used to analyse sleep-wake indexes, including total sleep time (TST) and circadian activity rhythms (CAR). Before and after shifts, the following data were collected, psychomotor vigilance task for reaction time, saliva cortisol for the level of alertness, and self-reported fatigue severity with the Lee Fatigue Scale-Short Form. RESULTS: All nurses reported clinically significant fatigue severity. Compared with the 8-hour shift nurses, the 12-hour shift nurses had significantly more TST (456 vs. 364\u2009min), higher saliva cortisol levels before the day shift (0.54 vs. 0.31), but longer reaction time before the night shift (286 vs. 277\u2009ms).

We investigated the role of dopamine in mediating this wing plasticity, motivated by a previous study that found higher dopamine titres in wingless- versus winged-producing aphid mothers. In this study, we found that manipulating dopamine levels in aphid mothers affected the numbers of winged offspring they produced. Specifically, asexual female adults injected with a dopamine agonist produced a lower percentage of winged offspring, while asexual females injected with a dopamine antagonist produced a higher percentage of winged offspring, matching expectations based on the titre difference. We also found that genes involved in dopamine synthesis, degradation and signalling were not differentially expressed between wingless- and winged-producing aphids.

Its pathogenesis is unknown, but it often occurs in patients who have undergone repeated antitumor therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma. Sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma is more likely to recur and has a worse prognosis than that of hepatocellular carcinoma. As no specific features have been identified in the symptoms, serological findings, or imaging findings, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the disease before surgical resection or autopsy. CASE REPORT An 83-year-old woman was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma 20 years ago. Radiofrequency ablation was initially performed. Thereafter, invasive, non-surgical treatments were repeated. The most recent treatment was 4 years ago, during which computed tomography suggested recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. However, upon needle biopsy, histological examination revealed spindle-shaped tumor cells and actively mitotic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed negative results for Arginase-1, HepPar1, and Glypican3 and positive results for AE1/AE3, CK7, and vimentin. Therefore, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation but progressed rapidly thereafter. Considering the rapid disease progression, the patient was treated conservatively. However, the patient's general condition gradually deteriorated, resulting in death. CONCLUSIONS Compared with hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma is more prone to recurrence and has a poorer prognosis. Therefore, aggressive surgical resection seems to be the most appropriate treatment for sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma at present.

Twenty-six clusters of approximately 4 mother-infant dyads each will be randomized 1:1 to one of two study arms (intervention or control). Clustering will be based on child's month of birth. In the intervention arm, group well child care will be provided on-site at a maternal substance use disorder treatment program. Mother-child dyads in the control arm will receive individual well child care from one nearby pediatric primary care clinic. Dyads in both study arms will be followed prospectively for 18\u00a0months, and data will be compared between the two study arms. Primary outcomes include well child care quality and utilization, child health knowledge, and parenting quality. DISCUSSION: The CHAMPS trial will provide evidence to determine if a group well child care offered on-site at an opioid treatment program for pregnant and parenting women is beneficial over individual well child care for families impacted by maternal opioid use disorder.

Adapting different f2f teaching methodologies to online environments is a significant problem that urgently needs attention, particularly in health education. METHODS: This study is part of design-based research and consists of three phases, which comprise design, analysis, and re-design. First, the animation-based problem scenarios were developed, and the learning environment (e-PBL) elements were organized. Then animation-based scenarios and the e-PBL environment were used, and problems related to the use of the environment were determined with an experimental study which was based on a pretest-posttest control group design. Finally, we used the following three measurement tools in the data collection process: a scale to determine the effectiveness of PBL, an attitude scale toward PBL, and the Clinical Objective Reasoning Exams (CORE). The study group in this research comprised 92 medical undergraduates (47 female and 45 male). RESULTS: There were similar scores between the two groups (e-PBL and f2f) in terms of the effectiveness of the platforms, the attitudes of the medical undergraduates, and the CORE scores. Also, there were positive relationships between the attitude scores, grade point average (GPA), and PBL scores of the undergraduates. Another significant positive relationship was found between the CORE scores and the GPA. CONCLUSIONS: The animation-supported e-PBL environment positively effects the participants' knowledge, skills, and attitude. Students who have high academic scores attitude positively towards e-PBL. Providing problem scenarios as multimedia animations is the innovative face of the research. They have been produced inexpensively with off-the-shelf web-based animation apps.

METHODS: Clinical outcomes after one treatment cycle are reported in women with AMH: 5-35 pmol/L. Oocytes were inseminated by intracytoplasmic sperm injection, blastocyst transfer was on Day 5 and remaining blastocysts were cryopreserved. Data collection included live births and neonatal health follow-up for all fresh/frozen transfers performed within one year after treatment allocation. RESULTS: In total, 104 women started stimulation, of whom 101 had oocyte recovery and 92 had blastocyst transfer. The average daily dose of follitropin delta was 11.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u00a0\u00b5g and the duration of stimulation was 10.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 days. The mean number of oocytes was 12.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4, the mean number of blastocysts was 5.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4, and 85% had at least one good-quality blastocyst. Following mostly single blastocyst transfer (95%), the ongoing pregnancy rate was 43%, the live-birth rate was 43%, and the cumulative live-birth rate was 58% per started stimulation. There were 6 cases of early OHSS (5.8%) graded as mild (n\u2009=\u20093) and moderate (n\u2009=\u20093) and 6 cases of late OHSS (5.8%) graded as moderate (n\u2009=\u20093) and severe (n\u2009=\u20093).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinicopathological data, including age, sex, preoperative clinical manifestation, surgical method, and histopathological examination results of 11 patients with appendix neuroendocrine neoplasms confirmed by surgery and pathology between November 2005 and January 2023, were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: In the histopathological examination of 7277 appendectomy specimens, 11 cases (0.2%) had appendix neuroendocrine neoplasms. Among the 11 patients, 8(72.7%) were males, and 3(27.3%) were females, with an average age of 48.1\u00a0years. All patients underwent emergency surgery.

Localized disease can present with nonspecific symptoms such as local mass, regional pain, and increased skin temperature. More severe cases may present with systemic symptoms such as malaise, weakness, fever, anemia, and weight loss. Among these lesions, retroperitoneal sarcomas are relatively uncommon and difficult to diagnose. Since they are usually asymptomatic until large enough to compress or invade the surrounding tissues, most are already advanced at first detection. Traditionally, the treatment of choice is complete surgical resection, sometimes combined with postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We report a case of EES with left renal artery invasion in the left retroperitoneal cavity successfully treated with transarterial embolization and surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman with a negative family history of cancer presented at our Urology Department with a large left retroperitoneal tumor found by magnetic resonance imaging during the health exam. Physical examination showed a soft abdomen and no palpable mass or tenderness. Imaging studies showed that the tumor covered the entire left renal pedicle, but the left kidney, left adrenal gland, and pancreas appeared tumor free. Since the tumor tightly covered the entire renal pedicle, tumor excision with radical nephrectomy was advised. The patient underwent transarterial embolization of the left renal artery with 10\u00a0mg of Gelfoam pieces daily before surgical excision. Tumor excision and left radical nephrectomy were uneventful the day after embolization. Post-operatively, the patient recovered well and was discharged on day 10. The final histopathological analysis showed a round blue cell tumor consistent with an Ewing sarcoma, and the surgical margins were tumor free.

CVCs and PICCs are less costly to place but have a higher complication rate than IVAPs. However, there is a lack of cost-utility comparisons among the three devices. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of three catheters for long-term chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. METHODS: This study used propensity score matching (PSM) to establish a retrospective cohort. Decision tree models were used to compare the cost-effectiveness of three different intravenous lines in breast cancer chemotherapy patients. Cost parameters were derived from data extracted from the outpatient and inpatient charging systems, and total costs included costs of placement, maintenance, extraction, and handling of complications; utility parameters were derived from previous cross-sectional survey results of the research group; and complication rates were derived from breast cancer catheterization patient information as well as follow-up information. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured for efficacy outcomes. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to compare the three strategies. To assess uncertainty in model parameters, sensitivity analyses (univariate sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis) were performed. RESULTS: A total of 10,718 patients (3780 after propensity score matching) were included. IVAPs had the smallest cost-utility ratio, and PICCs had the largest cost-utility ratio when left in place for more than 12 months. The incremental cost-utility ratio of PICC to CVC was $2375.08/QALY, IVAP to PICC was $522.01/QALY, and IVAP to CVC was $612.98/QALY. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios showed that IVAPs were more effective than CVCs and PICCs. Model regression analysis showed that the IVAP was recommended as the best regimen regardless of the catheter indwelling time (6 months, 12 months or more than 12 months). The reliability and stability of the model were verified by single-factor sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation (probabilistic sensitivity analysis).

Around 21% of young women in the world married before reaching the age of 18. Every year, 10 million girls under the age of 18 are married. Child marriage causes lifetime suffering, and its abolition was one component of the Sustainable Development Goal to achieve gender equality and empower women and girls. However;\u00a0abolition\u00a0of child marriage by 2030 will not happen because its prevalence in the community has remained stable. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of child marriage and its associated factors among reproductive-age women from March 7 to April 5, 2022 in Harari Regional State, eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March\u00a07 to April 5, 2022 among the reproductive age group in the Harari Region state, Eastern Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to find study participants. Data were obtained by face-to-face interview using a pre-tested structured questionnaire, input into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using Stata version 16. The proportion with 95% confidence interval (CI) and the summery measure were used to report the prevalence. A multivariable logistic regression analysis model was used to examine associated factors, and the results were provided as an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval. RESULT: In this study 986 were responded to the interview, making response rate of 99.6%. The median age of study participants was 22\u00a0years. The prevalence of child marriage was 33.7% [95% CI: 30.8-36.7] in this study. Being a Muslim (AOR\u2009=\u20092.30, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.26, 4.19), diploma or higher level of education (AOR\u2009=\u20090.26, 95%CI\u2009=\u2009.10, 0.70), rural residence (AOR\u2009=\u20095.39, 95% CI\u2009=\u20093.71, 7.82), a marriage arranged by others (AOR\u2009=\u20092.68, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.49, 4.82) and not knowing legal age of marriage (AOR\u2009=\u20094.49, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.57, 7.85) were significantly associated with child marriage.

Inexperienced medical students and parents who lack a medical technology background face significant challenges in understanding VRs. The purpose of this research is to develop three-dimensional (3D) printing models of VRs to provide new technical imaging support for medical education and parental consultation. METHODS: This study included 42 fetuses diagnosed as VRs. Foetal echocardiography, modeling and 3D printing were performed, and the dimensional accuracy of models was analyzed. The value of 3D printing in the teaching of VRs was analyzed based on comparing the test results before and after the teaching intervention of 48 medical students and the satisfaction survey. A brief survey was conducted to 40 parents to assess the value of the 3D printed model in prenatal consultations. RESULTS: Forty models of VRs were successfully obtained, which reproduced the anatomical shape of the VRs space with high dimensional accuracy. No differences in the prelecture test results were noted between the 3D printing group and the 2D image group. After the lecture, the knowledge of both groups improved, but the postlecture score and the change in the prelecture versus postlecture score were greater in the 3D printing group, and the subjective satisfaction survey feedback in the 3D printing group was also better (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Similar results were observed from the parental questionnaire, the vast majority of parents have an enthusiastic and positive attitude towards the use of 3D printed models and suggest using them in future prenatal consultations.

Speculations about a greater utilisation for minor cases have led to intensive media coverage, but empirical evidence is lacking. We investigated the development of low-acuity calls from 2018 to 2021 in the federal state of Berlin and its correlations with sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: We analysed over 1.5 million call documentations including medical dispatch codes, age, location and time using descriptive and inferential statistics and multivariate binary logistic regression. We defined a code list to classify low-acuity calls and merged the dataset with sociodemographic indicators and data on population density. RESULTS: The number of emergency calls (phone number 112 in Germany) increased by 9.1% from 2018 to 2021; however, the proportion of low-acuity calls did not increase. The regression model shows higher odds of low-acuity for young to medium age groups (especially for age 0-9, OR 1.50 [95% CI 1.45-1.55]; age 10-19, OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.71-1.83]; age 20-29, OR 1.64 [95% CI 1.59-1.68] and age 30-39, OR 1.40 [95% CI 1.37-1.44]; p\u2009<\u20090.001, reference group 80-89) and for females (OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.1-1.13], p\u2009<\u20090.001). Odds were slightly higher for calls from a neighbourhood with lower social status (OR 1.01 per index unit increase [95% CI 1.0-1.01], p\u2009<\u20090.05) and at the weekend (OR 1.02 [95% CI 1.0-1.04, p\u2009<\u20090.05]).

The aim of the study was to verify the correlation of different radiological parameters of carpal alignment and the development as well as the severity of DCTS in elderly female patients within 6\u00a0months of distal radial fracture (DRF). METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study that included 60 female patients with DRF within 6\u00a0months treated conservatively (30 patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of DCTS and 30 asymptomatic patients as a control group). Electrophysiological evaluation was done for all the participants, as well as radiological assessment to measure parameters of carpal alignment mainly radiocapitate distance (RCD), volar prominence height (VPH) and volar tilt (VT). RESULTS: There was a statistical significant difference between both groups regarding the radiological parameters of carpal alignment (The mean values of RCD, VT and VPH were\u2009-\u200911.48\u00a0mm,\u2009-\u200920.68\u00b0 angle, and 2.24\u00a0mm respectively in the symptomatic group).

Various aspects of its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment remain poorly understood. Furthermore, cases with secondary hyperparathyroidism are fewer. In this case report, we describe a case of left parathyroid carcinoma with secondary hyperparathyroidism. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 54-year-old woman who had been on hemodialysis since the age of 40\u00a0years. At 53\u00a0years of age, her calcium levels were high, and she was diagnosed with drug-resistant secondary hyperparathyroidism and was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment. Blood tests revealed calcium levels of 11.4\u00a0mg/dL and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels of 1007\u00a0pg/mL. Neck ultrasonography revealed a 22-mm large round hypoechoic mass, partially indistinct margins, and D/W ratio\u2009>\u20091 at the left thyroid lobe. Computed tomography scans revealed a 20-mm nodule at the left thyroid lobe. No enlarged lymph nodes or distant metastases were noted. (99m)Tc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile scintigraphy revealed an accumulation at the superior pole of the left thyroid lobe. Laryngeal endoscopy revealed paralysis of the left vocal cord, signifying recurrent nerve palsy due to parathyroid carcinoma. Based on these results, a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism and suspected left parathyroid carcinoma was made, and the patient underwent surgery. Pathology results revealed hyperplasia in the right upper and lower parathyroid glands. The left upper parathyroid gland showed capsular and venous invasion, and the diagnosis was left parathyroid carcinoma. At 4\u00a0months post-surgery, calcium levels improved to 8.7\u00a0mg/dL and intact PTH levels to 20\u00a0pg/mL, with no signs of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of left parathyroid carcinoma associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Concomitant secondary hyperparathyroidism may cause mild hypercalcemia compared to parathyroid carcinoma alone due to the added modification of dialysis.

Uganda has recognized the need for a human milk bank as an opportunity that offers reliable and healthy milk to babies who lack access to their mothers. However, there is little information on the perceptions towards donated breast milk in Uganda. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of mothers, fathers, and health workers on the use of donated breast milk at Nsambya and Naguru hospitals in Kampala district, central Uganda. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted at Nsambya and Naguru hospitals in central Uganda. The study consisted of 8 focus group discussions (FGDs) of 6 participants each and 19 key informant interviews (KIIs) among mothers, fathers, and health workers. Participants were purposively selected. Data collected were transcribed, translated from Luganda to English, and analyzed using thematic analysis. All data were organized and managed in Nvivo version 12.0. RESULTS: A total of 67 participants were involved in the study. Two main themes were identified: positive perceptions and negative perceptions. Participants linked donated breast milk to blood transfusion, believed it had nutrients comparable to the biological mother's milk, and thought it was an opportunity to avoid formula or cow milk and help babies that cannot access breast milk. However, the notable negative perceptions were; the feeling that donated breast milk is disgusting, could result in acquiring non-parental genes and traits, and that it was unsafe. Participants also feared that donated breast milk could be expensive and affect the bond between mother and child. CONCLUSION: In summary, participants had positive perceptions about donated breast milk but were concerned about the potential side effects. Health workers should take extra precautions to ensure that donated breast milk is safe. The development of appropriate information and communication programs to sensitize the public about the benefits of donated breast milk will improve the uptake.

The aim of this work is to analyse stillbirth and late miscarriage cases in unvaccinated pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first two waves (wild-type period) in Belgium. METHODS: Stillbirths and late miscarriages in our prospective observational nationwide registry of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women (n\u2009=\u2009982) were classified by three authors using a modified WHO-UMC classification system for standardized case causality assessment. RESULTS: Our cohort included 982 hospitalised pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, with 23 fetal demises (10 late miscarriages from 12 to 22\u00a0weeks of gestational age and 13 stillbirths).

The clinical-surgical results of using a standard hysterectomy were analyzed with a modified subtotal hysterectomy (MSTH) in patients with PAS type 4. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective, multicenter study included 337 patients of PAS; thirty-two corresponding to PAS type 4, from three PAS reference hospitals, CEMIC, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fundaci\u00f3n Valle de Lili, Cali, Colombia, and Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia, between January 2015 and December 2020. PAS was diagnosed by abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound and topographically characterized by ultrafast T2 weighted MRI. In persistent macroscopic hematuria after MSTH, the surgeon performs an intentional cystotomy and uses a square compression suture to achieve the hemostasis inside the bladder wall.According to a PAS topographical classification, the patients with low-vesical cervical involvement compared with PAS located in relation with the upper blader (type1), upper parametrium (type 2 upper), and also with PAS situated in the lower vesical-trigon space (type 3). PAS 3 and 4 are located in identical area, but in type 3, group A, the vesicouterine space was dissectible, and in type 4, group B, significant fibrosis made surgical dissection extremely challenging. Furthermore, group B was divided into patients treated with total hysterectomy (HT) and those treated with a modified subtotal hysterectomy (MSTH). The surgical requirements to perform an MSHT included the availability of proximal vascular control at the aortic level (internal manual aortic compression, aortic endovascular balloon, aortic loop, or aortic cross-clamping). Then surgeon performed an upper segmental hysterotomy, avoiding the abnormal placenta invasion area; after that, the fetus was delivered, and the umbilical cord was ligated.After uterine exteriorization, the surgeon applies a continuous circular suture with number 2 polyglactin 910, taking some portions of the myometrium -to avoid unintentional slipping- around the lower uterine segment and a 3-4\u2009cm proximal to the abnormal adhesion of the placenta. After tightening hard the circular suture, the uterine segment was circumferentially cut, three centimeters proximal to the circular hemostatic sutures. Next, the surgery follows the upper steps of conventional hysterectomy without changes. Additionally, the histological presence of fibrosis was examined in all samples. RESULTS: Modified subtotal hysterectomy in patients with PAS type 4 (cervical-trigonal fibrosis) resulted in a significant cl\u00ednico-surgical improvement over total hysterectomy. The median operative time and intraoperative bleeding were 140\u2009min (IQR 90--240) and 1895\u2009mL (IQR 1300-2500) in patients undergoing modified subtotal hysterectomy, and 260\u2009min (IQR 210-287) and 2900\u2009mL (IQR 2150-5500) in patients treated with total hysterectomy, respectively. The complication rate was 20% for MSHT and 82.3% for patients with a total hysterectomy.

The relationship between biological rhythms of BP and resilience was cross-sectionally assessed by 7-day/24-hour chronobiologic screening in a rural Japanese community (Tosa), with focus on the 12-hour component and the \"circadian-circasemidian coupling\" of systolic (S) BP. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Tosa residents (N = 239, 147 women, 23-74 years), free of anti-hypertensive medication, completed 7-day/24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. The circadian-circasemidian coupling was determined individually by computing the difference between the circadian phase and the circasemidian morning-phase of SBP. Participants were classified into three groups: those with a short coupling interval of about 4.5 hours (Group A), those with an intermediate coupling interval of about 6.0 hours (Group B), and those with a long coupling interval of about 8.0 hours (Group C). RESULTS: Residents of Group B who showed optimal circadian-circasemidian coordination had less pronounced morning and evening SBP surges, as compared to residents of Group A (10.82 vs 14.29 mmHg, P < 0.0001) and Group C (11.86 vs 15.21 mmHg, P < 0.0001), respectively.

Serum and salivary immunoglobulin heavy constant alpha 1 (IGHA1) are major markers of immunosuppression by HIE. Although much is known about the systemic immunosuppressive response, little is known about its local response in the oral cavity, lungs, bronchial tubes, and skin. The oral cavity allows bacteria or viruses to enter the body. Saliva covers the epidermis of the oral cavity and plays an important role in the local stress response by preventing infection. In this study, we examined the properties of saliva secreted during the local stress response for half-marathon (HM) induced IGHA1 protein expression using quantitative proteomics. METHODS: The Exercise Group (ExG) (19 healthy female university students) participated in a HM race. The Non-Exercise Group (NExG) (16 healthy female university students) did not participate in the ExG. The ExG saliva samples were collected 1 h pre and 2 h and 4 h post-HM. The NExG saliva samples were collected at the same time intervals. The saliva volume, protein concentration, and relative IGHA1 expression were analyzed. In addition, 1 h pre and 2 h post- HM saliva samples were analyzed by iTRAQ. The identified factors in iTRAQ were analyzed for the ExG and the NExG using western blotting. RESULTS: We identified kallikrein 1 (KLK1), immunoglobulin kappa chain (IgK), and cystatin S (CST4) as suppression factors, as well as IGHA1, which has been reported to be an immunological stress marker. IGHA1 (p = 0.003), KLK1 (p = 0.011), IGK (p = 0.002), and CST4 (p = 0.003) were suppressed 2 h post-HM compared with their levels pre HM, and IGHA1 (p < 0.001), KLK1 (p = 0.004), and CST4 (p = 0.006) were suppressed 4 h post-HM. There was also a positive correlation between IGHA1, IGK, and CST4 levels at 2 and 4 h post-HM. In addition, KLK1 and IGK levels at 2 h post-HM were positively correlated. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the salivary proteome is regulated, and antimicrobial proteins are suppressed post-HM. These results suggest that oral immunity was transiently suppressed post-HM. The positive correlation of each protein at 2 and 4 h post-HM suggests that the suppressed state was similarly regulated up to 4 h after a HM.

Temperament and character are the primary dimensions of personality, and both are influenced genetically. Temperament represents our emotional core, while character reflects our goals and values as we develop through life. Research shows that where people live, their social, economic, and physical environment can influence attitudes and behaviors, and these have links to variations in personality traits. There are few studies that focus on Australian personality as temperament and character. Using an Australian general population sample, we examined the psychometric properties of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCIR140) and investigated the associations between TCIR140 traits with both sociodemographic variables and measures of well-being. In addition, we investigated differences in temperament and character between our Australian general population sample and published results of similar studies from other countries. METHODS: Australians (N\u00a0=\u00a01,510) completed the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCIR-140), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Cronbach's alpha and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) examined the TCIR-140 psychometrics. Correlation analyzes, independent sample t-tests and ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons analyzed the sample. RESULTS: Cronbach's alphas were high, ranging from \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.78-0.92, and the CFA confirmed two constructs of temperament and character.

METHODS: We utilized black phosphorus (BP) as a drug carrier and sonosensitizer, integrated with TAM and tumor-targeting ligand folic acid (FA) to construct TAM@BP-FA for synergistic endocrine and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) of breast cancer. The exfoliated BP nanosheets were modified through in situ polymerization of dopamine, followed by electrostatic adsorption of TAM and FA. The anticancer effect of TAM@BP-FA was evaluated through in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor model.

These regions, predominantly inhabited by highly mobile rural communities with strong cross-border cultural ties, present major challenges in managing movement of people and COVID-19 preventive measures. Our study sought to assess knowledge of COVID-19 prevention behaviours, how these varied by socioeconomic (SEC) factors and the challenges of engagement and implementation, in two border counties of Kenya. METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods study using a household e-survey (Busia, N=294; Mandera, N=288; 57% females, 43% males), and qualitative telephone interviews (N=73: Busia 55; Mandera 18) with policy actors, healthcare workers, truckers and traders, and community members. Interviews were transcribed, English translated and analysed using the framework method. Associations between SEC (wealth quintiles, educational level) and knowledge of COVID-19 preventive behaviours were explored using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Participants were mostly educated to primary school level (54.4% Busia, 61.6% Mandera). Knowledge of COVID-19 prevention varied by behaviour: hand washing-86.5%, use of hand sanitiser-74.8%, wearing a face mask-63.1%, covering the mouth when sneezing or coughing-56.3% and social distancing-40.1%. Differences in knowledge by area, educational level and the wealth index were marked, greatest for Mandera, the less educated and the poor. Interviews with stakeholders revealed challenges in health messaging, psychosocial and socioeconomic factors, lack of preparedness for truck border crossings, language barrier, denial and livelihood insecurity as key challenges to engagement with and implementation of COVID-19 prevention behaviours in the border regions. CONCLUSION: The influence of SEC disparities and border dynamics on knowledge and engagement with COVID-19 prevention behaviours calls for contextually appropriate risk communication strategies that are cognisant of community needs and local patterns of information flow.

In dioecious species, the two sexes may exhibit different degrees of phenotypic plasticity and theoretical models indicate that such differences may confer an adaptive advantage when the population is subject to directional selection, either because of a systematically varying environment or a load of deleterious mutations. The effect stems from the fundamental asymmetry between the two sexes: female fertility is more limited than male fertility. Whether this asymmetry is sufficient for sexual dimorphism in phenotypic plasticity to evolve is, however, not obvious. Here, we show that even in conditions where it provides an adaptive advantage, dimorphic phenotypic plasticity may be evolutionarily unstable due to sexual selection. This is the case, in particular, for panmictic populations where mating partnerships are formed at random. However, we show that the effects of sexual selection can be counteracted when mating occurs within groups of related individuals. Under this condition, sexual dimorphism in phenotypic plasticity can not only evolve but offset the twofold cost of males.
