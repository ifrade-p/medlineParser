Food intake was assessed using the Previous Day Food Questionnaire and the level of physical activity by the Previous Day Physical Activity Questionnaire. The listed foods were classified according to the extent and purpose of industrial processing, using the NOVA classification. Pearson's \u03c72 test, Fisher's exact test, \u03c72 with Yates correction, and Poisson regression were used in the statistical analysis, estimating the crude and adjusted prevalence ratio, with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The prevalence of daily ultra-processed food consumption was 69.6%. After adjusted analyses, the consumption of ultra-processed food was associated with the omission of breakfast, mid-afternoon snack, supper, low physical activity, and consumption of risk foods. On the other hand, consumption of in natura or minimally processed foods was associated with older age, the consumption of lunch, mid-afternoon snack, dinner, and protective foods.

Serum levels were adequate in 30 samples (31.57%), subtherapeutic in 41 (43.15%), and supratherapeutic in 24 (25.26%). IFX dosages were optimized for 40 patients (42.10%), maintained for 31 (32.63%), and discontinued for 7 (7.60%). The intervals between infusions were shortened in 17.85% of the cases. In 55 tests (55.79%), the therapeutic approach was exclusively defined according to IFX and/or serum antibody levels. The assessment of patients one year later indicated that: the approach was maintained with IFX for thirty-eight patients (69.09%); the class of biological agent was changed for eight (14.54%); changes using the same class of biological agent occurred for two patients (3.63%); the medication was discontinued and not replaced for three patients (5.45%), and four patients (7.27%) were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: There were no differences in TL between groups with or without immunosuppressants, serum albumin (ALB), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), FC, CRP, and endoscopic and imaging examinations. Current therapeutic approach could be maintained for almost 70% of patients.

This study analyzed pancreatic cancer mortality rates trends, and their correlation with HDI in Brazil over 40 years. METHODS: Data on pancreatic cancer mortality in Brazil between 1979 and 2019 were obtained from the Mortality Information System (SIM). Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and Annual Average Percent Change (AAPC) were calculated. Pearson's correlation test was applied to compare mortality rates and HDI for three periods: 1986-1995 was correlated with HDI of 1991, 1996-2005 with HDI of 2000, and 2006-2015 with HDI of 2010; and to the correlation of AAPC versus the percentage change in HDI from 1991 to 2010. RESULTS: A total of 209,425 deaths from pancreatic cancer were reported in Brazil, with an annual increase of 1.5% in men and 1.9% in women. There was an upward trend for mortality in most Brazilian states, with the highest trends observed in the North and Northeast states.

Liver involvement is frequent, but the impact on the clinical course and outcomes are controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess liver function at the admission and evaluate its effects on severity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of hospitalized patients in a tertiary hospital in Brazil, with a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between April and October 2020. 1080 out of 1229 patients had liver enzymes on admission and were divided in two cohorts, based on the presence or absence of abnormal liver enzymes (ALE). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, clinical severity, and mortality were evaluated. Patients were followed until discharge, death or transfer to another institution. RESULTS: Median age was 60 years and 51.5% were male. The more frequent comorbidities were hypertension (51.2%), and diabetes (31.6%). Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis were present in 8.6% and 2.3%, respectively.

We also aimed to estimate the capacity of these equations for explaining VO2max variations in adolescents according to sex. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in high schools in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, Southern Brazil. METHODS: This study included 879 adolescents (14-19 years) from Southern Brazil. Aerobic fitness was assessed using the modified Canadian Aerobic Fitness Test. The independent variable was body fat percentage predicted by the Lohman, Boileau, and Slaughter equations.

RESULTS: All anthropometric prediction equations used to estimate body fat percentage explained VO2max variations in adolescents. In male adolescents, both regression models based on the Boileau et al.12 and Lohman10 equations revealed higher explanatory power for VO2max (20%) compared with that based on the Slaughter et al.13 equation (19%). In female adolescents, the model based on the anthropometric equation of Slaughter et al.13 showed the greatest explanatory power for VO2max (18%).

HIF-1\u03b1 and ET-1 proteins were examined immunohistochemically, and placental tissues were examined ultrastructurally. RESULTS: Increase in syncytial proliferation, endothelial damage in vessels, and increase in collagen were observed in preeclamptic placentas. As a result of preeclampsia, an increase was observed in HIF-1\u03b1 and ET-1 protein levels in the placenta. Dilatation of endoplasmic reticulum and loss of cristae in mitochondria were observed in trophoblast cells in preeclamptic placental sections. CONCLUSIONS: High regulation of oxygen resulting from preeclampsia has been shown to be a critical determinant of placentagenesis and plays an important role in placental differentiation, changes in maternal and fetal blood circulation, trophoblastic invasion, and syncytial node increase.

Species diversity in the survey sites was noted. Collection from these seventeen various types of potential larval habitats, yielded a total of 42,430 immature constituting 41,556 larvae and 874 pupae. Among these only 19,651 adult mosquitoes emerged comprising 11,512 female and 8,139 male mosquitoes. 78% (n= 15333) of mosquito larvae were from permanent and 22% (n=4318) were from temporary breeding sites. This study showed that Peshawar valley harbours 15 species from the genera Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex and Culiseta. When the density of each species was examined, Culex quinquifasciatus was found to be dominant (79%) and constant in distribution. Among the temporary habitats Aedes albopictus was found as the most prevalent species particularly from tree holes and water cisterns. The highest intensity of mosquitoes was in June (2243 emerged adults) and November (2667 emerged adults) while the lowest was in January (203 emerged adults). A perfect positive correlation (r = +0.8) was found between temperature and population of mosquitoes (df 10 and \u03b1 0.05). The species diversity index for mosquitoes remained between 0.12 and 1.76. The Margalef's richness components was noticeably low for bamboo traps (0.2) and fairly high for rice fields, Percolating water and Animal tracks (1.3) which shows the abundance of mosquito species in these habitats. Similarly Pielou's Evenness was highest for bamboo traps (E=1) showing species uniform distribution. Animal tracks were presumed not only the diverse habitat rather also possessed high value for species richness and species evenness.

The proportion of immunosuppressive therapy in the remission group was also higher (86.4% vs. 30.4%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Compared with conservative treatment, patients with combined treatment with glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide (CTX) or glucocorticoid and calcineurin inhibitor (CNIs) achieved higher remission rate (glucocorticoid plus cyclophosphamide vs. conservative treatment, 84.6% vs. 27.3%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.001; glucocorticoid plus calcineurin inhibitor vs. conservative treatment, 88.0% vs. 27.3%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Further analysis showed that compared with patients who underwent conservative treatment, the proportion of males, the levels of uPCR, uACR, BUN, Scr, CysC and PLA2R antigen-positive staining rate in kidney biopsy were higher in those who underwent combined treatment with glucocorticoid and CTX, while the levels of eGFR, TP and ALB were lower (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, patients who received combined treatment with glucocorticoid and CNIs had higher levels of uPCR, uACR, TC and lower levels of TP, ALB than those who received conservative treatment (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

The glomerular PLA2R and IgG4 antigen deposition were frequently detected accompanied by glomerulosclerosis and severe tubulointerstitial injury. For high-risk elderly patients with severe proteinuria, early initial immunosuppressive therapy could achieve a higher urinary protein remission rate.

The circadian clock is regulated by the transcription-translation-negative feedback loop in the body, which can regulate the activities of tissues and organs. Its normal maintenance is important for the health, growth, and reproduction of organisms. In contrast, due to the season changes of the environment, organisms have also formed annual cycle physiological changes in their bodies, such as seasonal estrus, etc. The annual rhythm of living things is mainly affected by environmental factors such as photoperiod, and is related to gene expression, hormone content, morphological changes of cell and tissues in vivo. Melatonin is an important signal to recognize the changes of photoperiod, and the circadian clock plays an important role in the pituitary to interpret the signal of melatonin and regulate the changes of downstream signals, which plays an important guiding role in the recognition of annual changes in the environment and the generation of the body's annual rhythm.

Here, I compared larval mortality between populations of ornamented and non-ornamented dragonfly species. Since males produce more exaggerated melanin wing ornaments than females, I tested if larval mortality of males is higher in populations of species that have evolved adult male wing ornamentation.

We investigated the role of dopamine in mediating this wing plasticity, motivated by a previous study that found higher dopamine titres in wingless- versus winged-producing aphid mothers. In this study, we found that manipulating dopamine levels in aphid mothers affected the numbers of winged offspring they produced. Specifically, asexual female adults injected with a dopamine agonist produced a lower percentage of winged offspring, while asexual females injected with a dopamine antagonist produced a higher percentage of winged offspring, matching expectations based on the titre difference. We also found that genes involved in dopamine synthesis, degradation and signalling were not differentially expressed between wingless- and winged-producing aphids.

Its pathogenesis is unknown, but it often occurs in patients who have undergone repeated antitumor therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma. Sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma is more likely to recur and has a worse prognosis than that of hepatocellular carcinoma. As no specific features have been identified in the symptoms, serological findings, or imaging findings, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the disease before surgical resection or autopsy. CASE REPORT An 83-year-old woman was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma 20 years ago. Radiofrequency ablation was initially performed. Thereafter, invasive, non-surgical treatments were repeated. The most recent treatment was 4 years ago, during which computed tomography suggested recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. However, upon needle biopsy, histological examination revealed spindle-shaped tumor cells and actively mitotic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed negative results for Arginase-1, HepPar1, and Glypican3 and positive results for AE1/AE3, CK7, and vimentin. Therefore, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation but progressed rapidly thereafter. Considering the rapid disease progression, the patient was treated conservatively. However, the patient's general condition gradually deteriorated, resulting in death. CONCLUSIONS Compared with hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma is more prone to recurrence and has a poorer prognosis. Therefore, aggressive surgical resection seems to be the most appropriate treatment for sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma at present. Additional hepatic resection or follow-up imaging in a short period should be considered at the time of diagnosis of sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma by biopsy, considering the risk of seeding or recurrence.\") total:1947"]["('37194202', \"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Placental pathology is a well-known cause of perinatal and neonatalmortality and morbidity, and may correlate with placental growth, which can be assessed indirectly by anthropometric placental measurements.

The pilot flight ability evaluation scale was used as the criterion of test validity. According to the scale score, pilots were divided into high, middle, or low spatial ability groups pursuant to the 27% allocation principle. Differences in reaction time (RT), correct rate (CR), and correct number per second (CNPS) of MRT between groups were compared. Correlations between scale scores and MRT scores were analyzed. RT, CR, and CNPS of MRT among different age groups and between genders were also compared.RESULTS: The RT of the high spatial ability group was remarkably slower than that of the low spatial ability group (363.4\\u2009\u00b1\\u2009140.2\\u2009s, 458.1\\u2009\u00b1\\u2009151.7\\u2009s).

Evidence supporting the use of group well child care for mothers with opioid use disorder, however, is lacking. The overall objective of the Child Healthcare at MATER Pediatric Study (CHAMPS) trial is to evaluate a group model of well child care for mothers with opioid use disorder and their children. METHODS: CHAMPS is a single-site 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. A total of 108 mother-child dyads will be enrolled into the study. Twenty-six clusters of approximately 4 mother-infant dyads each will be randomized 1:1 to one of two study arms (intervention or control). Clustering will be based on child's month of birth. In the intervention arm, group well child care will be provided on-site at a maternal substance use disorder treatment program. Mother-child dyads in the control arm will receive individual well child care from one nearby pediatric primary care clinic. Dyads in both study arms will be followed prospectively for 18\\xa0months, and data will be compared between the two study arms. Primary outcomes include well child care quality and utilization, child health knowledge, and parenting quality.

Adapting different f2f teaching methodologies to online environments is a significant problem that urgently needs attention, particularly in health education. METHODS: This study is part of design-based research and consists of three phases, which comprise design, analysis, and re-design. First, the animation-based problem scenarios were developed, and the learning environment (e-PBL) elements were organized. Then animation-based scenarios and the e-PBL environment were used, and problems related to the use of the environment were determined with an experimental study which was based on a pretest-posttest control group design. Finally, we used the following three measurement tools in the data collection process: a scale to determine the effectiveness of PBL, an attitude scale toward PBL, and the Clinical Objective Reasoning Exams (CORE). The study group in this research comprised 92 medical undergraduates (47 female and 45 male). RESULTS: There were similar scores between the two groups (e-PBL and f2f) in terms of the effectiveness of the platforms, the attitudes of the medical undergraduates, and the CORE scores. Also, there were positive relationships between the attitude scores, grade point average (GPA), and PBL scores of the undergraduates. Another significant positive relationship was found between the CORE scores and the GPA. CONCLUSIONS: The animation-supported e-PBL environment positively effects the participants' knowledge, skills, and attitude. Students who have high academic scores attitude positively towards e-PBL. Providing problem scenarios as multimedia animations is the innovative face of the research. They have been produced inexpensively with off-the-shelf web-based animation apps.

Data collection included live births and neonatal health follow-up for all fresh/frozen transfers performed within one year after treatment allocation. RESULTS: In total, 104 women started stimulation, of whom 101 had oocyte recovery and 92 had blastocyst transfer. The average daily dose of follitropin delta was 11.0\\u2009\u00b1\\u20091.6\\xa0\u00b5g and the duration of stimulation was 10.3\\u2009\u00b1\\u20091.6 days.

RESULTS: In the histopathological examination of 7277 appendectomy specimens, 11 cases (0.2%) had appendix neuroendocrine neoplasms. Among the 11 patients, 8(72.7%) were males, and 3(27.3%) were females, with an average age of 48.1\\xa0years. All patients underwent emergency surgery.

Localized disease can present with nonspecific symptoms such as local mass, regional pain, and increased skin temperature. More severe cases may present with systemic symptoms such as malaise, weakness, fever, anemia, and weight loss. Among these lesions, retroperitoneal sarcomas are relatively uncommon and difficult to diagnose. Since they are usually asymptomatic until large enough to compress or invade the surrounding tissues, most are already advanced at first detection. Traditionally, the treatment of choice is complete surgical resection, sometimes combined with postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We report a case of EES with left renal artery invasion in the left retroperitoneal cavity successfully treated with transarterial embolization and surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman with a negative family history of cancer presented at our Urology Department with a large left retroperitoneal tumor found by magnetic resonance imaging during the health exam. Physical examination showed a soft abdomen and no palpable mass or tenderness. Imaging studies showed that the tumor covered the entire left renal pedicle, but the left kidney, left adrenal gland, and pancreas appeared tumor free. Since the tumor tightly covered the entire renal pedicle, tumor excision with radical nephrectomy was advised. The patient underwent transarterial embolization of the left renal artery with 10\\xa0mg of Gelfoam pieces daily before surgical excision. Tumor excision and left radical nephrectomy were uneventful the day after embolization. Post-operatively, the patient recovered well and was discharged on day 10. The final histopathological analysis showed a round blue cell tumor consistent with an Ewing sarcoma, and the surgical margins were tumor free.

CVCs and PICCs are less costly to place but have a higher complication rate than IVAPs. However, there is a lack of cost-utility comparisons among the three devices. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of three catheters for long-term chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. METHODS: This study used propensity score matching (PSM) to establish a retrospective cohort. Decision tree models were used to compare the cost-effectiveness of three different intravenous lines in breast cancer chemotherapy patients. Cost parameters were derived from data extracted from the outpatient and inpatient charging systems, and total costs included costs of placement, maintenance, extraction, and handling of complications; utility parameters were derived from previous cross-sectional survey results of the research group; and complication rates were derived from breast cancer catheterization patient information as well as follow-up information. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured for efficacy outcomes. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to compare the three strategies. To assess uncertainty in model parameters, sensitivity analyses (univariate sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis) were performed. RESULTS: A total of 10,718 patients (3780 after propensity score matching) were included. IVAPs had the smallest cost-utility ratio, and PICCs had the largest cost-utility ratio when left in place for more than 12 months. The incremental cost-utility ratio of PICC to CVC was $2375.08/QALY, IVAP to PICC was $522.01/QALY, and IVAP to CVC was $612.98/QALY. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios showed that IVAPs were more effective than CVCs and PICCs. Model regression analysis showed that the IVAP was recommended as the best regimen regardless of the catheter indwelling time (6 months, 12 months or more than 12 months). The reliability and stability of the model were verified by single-factor sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation (probabilistic sensitivity analysis).

These participants completed a measure of abusive behaviour in romantic relationship, conflict resolution styles, relationship satisfaction and need satisfaction in romantic relationship. Models 1 and 4 of Process Hayes were used in SPSS 22 to investigate moderation and mediation roles. RESULTS: According to the results, ABRR has a full mediator role in the relationship between subordination and relationship satisfaction and has a partial mediator role in the relationship between retreat and relationship satisfaction. Another result of the study showed that ABRR negatively affected relationship satisfaction and that relatedness and autonomy moderated this relationship. Moderator roles are strong when the level of relatedness and autonomy are high.

The regression model shows higher odds of low-acuity for young to medium age groups (especially for age 0-9, OR 1.50 [95% CI 1.45-1.55]; age 10-19, OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.71-1.83]; age 20-29, OR 1.64 [95% CI 1.59-1.68] and age 30-39, OR 1.40 [95% CI 1.37-1.44]; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001, reference group 80-89) and for females (OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.1-1.13], p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Odds were slightly higher for calls from a neighbourhood with lower social status (OR 1.01 per index unit increase [95% CI 1.0-1.01], p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and at the weekend (OR 1.02 [95% CI 1.0-1.04, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05]). No significant association of the call volume with population density was detected. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides valuable new insights into pre-hospital emergency care. Low-acuity calls were not the primary driver of increased EMS utilisation in Berlin. Younger age is the strongest predictor for low-acuity calls in the model. The association with female gender is significant, while socially deprived neighbourhoods play a minor role.

The aim of the study was to verify the correlation of different radiological parameters of carpal alignment and the development as well as the severity of DCTS in elderly female patients within 6\\xa0months of distal radial fracture (DRF). METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study that included 60 female patients with DRF within 6\\xa0months treated conservatively (30 patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of DCTS and 30 asymptomatic patients as a control group). Electrophysiological evaluation was done for all the participants, as well as radiological assessment to measure parameters of carpal alignment mainly radiocapitate distance (RCD), volar prominence height (VPH) and volar tilt (VT). RESULTS: There was a statistical significant difference between both groups regarding the radiological parameters of carpal alignment (The mean values of RCD, VT and VPH were\\u2009-\\u200911.48\\xa0mm,\\u2009-\\u200920.68\u00b0 angle, and 2.24\\xa0mm respectively in the symptomatic group). A strong correlation was found between decrease in the parameters of carpal alignment and the severity of DCTS. Logistic regression analysis showed that VT is strongly involved in the development of DCTS.

Various aspects of its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment remain poorly understood. Furthermore, cases with secondary hyperparathyroidism are fewer. In this case report, we describe a case of left parathyroid carcinoma with secondary hyperparathyroidism. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 54-year-old woman who had been on hemodialysis since the age of 40\\xa0years. At 53\\xa0years of age, her calcium levels were high, and she was diagnosed with drug-resistant secondary hyperparathyroidism and was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment. Blood tests revealed calcium levels of 11.4\\xa0mg/dL and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels of 1007\\xa0pg/mL. Neck ultrasonography revealed a 22-mm large round hypoechoic mass, partially indistinct margins, and D/W ratio\\u2009>\\u20091 at the left thyroid lobe. Computed tomography scans revealed a 20-mm nodule at the left thyroid lobe. No enlarged lymph nodes or distant metastases were noted. (99m)Tc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile scintigraphy revealed an accumulation at the superior pole of the left thyroid lobe. Laryngeal endoscopy revealed paralysis of the left vocal cord, signifying recurrent nerve palsy due to parathyroid carcinoma. Based on these results, a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism and suspected left parathyroid carcinoma was made, and the patient underwent surgery. Pathology results revealed hyperplasia in the right upper and lower parathyroid glands. The left upper parathyroid gland showed capsular and venous invasion, and the diagnosis was left parathyroid carcinoma. At 4\\xa0months post-surgery, calcium levels improved to 8.7\\xa0mg/dL and intact PTH levels to 20\\xa0pg/mL, with no signs of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of left parathyroid carcinoma associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Concomitant secondary hyperparathyroidism may cause mild hypercalcemia compared to parathyroid carcinoma alone due to the added modification of dialysis. Although our patient also presented with mild hypercalcemia, a D/W ratio\\u2009>\\u20091 on preoperative echocardiography and presence of recurrent nerve palsy on laryngoscopy led to the suspicion and treatment of parathyroid carcinoma preoperatively.') total:2290"]["('37193959', \"AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast milk is crucial for the nutritional and developmentalmilestones in the first two years of life. Uganda has recognized the need for a human milk bank as an opportunity that offers reliable and healthy milk to babies who lack access to their mothers. However, there is little information on the perceptions towards donated breast milk in Uganda. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of mothers, fathers, and health workers on the use of donated breast milk at Nsambya and Naguru hospitals in Kampala district, central Uganda. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted at Nsambya and Naguru hospitals in central Uganda. The study consisted of 8 focus group discussions (FGDs) of 6 participants each and 19 key informant interviews (KIIs) among mothers, fathers, and health workers. Participants were purposively selected. Data collected were transcribed, translated from Luganda to English, and analyzed using thematic analysis. All data were organized and managed in Nvivo version 12.0. RESULTS: A total of 67 participants were involved in the study. Two main themes were identified: positive perceptions and negative perceptions. Participants linked donated breast milk to blood transfusion, believed it had nutrients comparable to the biological mother's milk, and thought it was an opportunity to avoid formula or cow milk and help babies that cannot access breast milk. However, the notable negative perceptions were; the feeling that donated breast milk is disgusting, could result in acquiring non-parental genes and traits, and that it was unsafe. Participants also feared that donated breast milk could be expensive and affect the bond between mother and child. CONCLUSION: In summary, participants had positive perceptions about donated breast milk but were concerned about the potential side effects. Health workers should take extra precautions to ensure that donated breast milk is safe. The development of appropriate information and communication programs to sensitize the public about the benefits of donated breast milk will improve the uptake. Further research should focus on understanding the social-cultural beliefs regarding donated breast milk.\") total:2209"]["('37193958', 'AB  - BACKGROUND: Stillbirth has been recognized as a possible complication of aSARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, probably due to destructive placental lesions (SARS-CoV-2 placentitis). The aim of this work is to analyse stillbirth and late miscarriage cases in unvaccinated pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first two waves (wild-type period) in Belgium. METHODS: Stillbirths and late miscarriages in our prospective observational nationwide registry of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women (n\\u2009=\\u2009982) were classified by three authors using a modified WHO-UMC classification system for standardized case causality assessment. RESULTS: Our cohort included 982 hospitalised pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, with 23 fetal demises (10 late miscarriages from 12 to 22\\xa0weeks of gestational age and 13 stillbirths). The stillbirth rate was 9.5\u2030 for singleton pregnancies and 83.3\u2030 for multiple pregnancies, which seems higher than for the background population (respectively 5.6\u2030 and 13.8\u2030). The agreement between assessors about the causal relationship with SARS-Cov-2 infection was fair (global weighted kappa value of 0.66). Among these demises, 17.4% (4/23) were \"certainly\" attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 13.0% (3/23) \"probably\" and 30.4% (7/23) \"possibly\". Better agreement in the rating was noticed when pathological examination of the placenta and identification of the virus were available, underlining the importance of a thorough investigation in case of intra-uterine fetal demise. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 causality assessment of late miscarriage and stillbirth cases in our Belgian nationwide case series has shown that half of the fetal losses could be attributable to SARS-CoV-2.

The objective of this study was to characterize the cells at the maternal-fetal interface (MFI) in term and preterm pregnancies in both the laboring and non-laboring state in Black women, who have among the highest preterm birth rates in the U.S. Using mass cytometry to obtain high-dimensional single-cell resolution, we identified 31 cell populations at the MFI, including 25 immune cell types and six non-immune cell types. Among the immune cells, maternal PD1(+) CD8 T cell subsets were less abundant in term laboring compared to term non-laboring women. Among the non-immune cells, PD-L1(+) maternal (stromal) and fetal (extravillous trophoblast) cells were less abundant in preterm laboring compared to term laboring women. Consistent with these observations, the expression of CD274, the gene encoding PD-L1, was significantly depressed and less responsive to fetal signaling molecules in cultured mesenchymal stromal cells from the decidua of preterm compared to term women.

Single KoSC or KpSC ASV fingerprinted strains dominated the gut microbiota, suggesting exclusionary Klebsiella competition for luminal resources. Enterococcus faecalis was co-dominant with KoSC but present infrequently with KpSC. Cytotoxin-producing KoSC members were identified in most NEC subjects and were less frequent in controls. Few Klebsiella strains were shared between subjects.

The clinical-surgical results of using a standard hysterectomy were analyzed with a modified subtotal hysterectomy (MSTH) in patients with PAS type 4. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective, multicenter study included 337 patients of PAS; thirty-two corresponding to PAS type 4, from three PAS reference hospitals, CEMIC, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fundaci\u00f3n Valle de Lili, Cali, Colombia, and Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia, between January 2015 and December 2020. PAS was diagnosed by abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound and topographically characterized by ultrafast T2 weighted MRI. In persistent macroscopic hematuria after MSTH, the surgeon performs an intentional cystotomy and uses a square compression suture to achieve the hemostasis inside the bladder wall.According to a PAS topographical classification, the patients with low-vesical cervical involvement compared with PAS located in relation with the upper blader (type1), upper parametrium (type 2 upper), and also with PAS situated in the lower vesical-trigon space (type 3). PAS 3 and 4 are located in identical area, but in type 3, group A, the vesicouterine space was dissectible, and in type 4, group B, significant fibrosis made surgical dissection extremely challenging. Furthermore, group B was divided into patients treated with total hysterectomy (HT) and those treated with a modified subtotal hysterectomy (MSTH). The surgical requirements to perform an MSHT included the availability of proximal vascular control at the aortic level (internal manual aortic compression, aortic endovascular balloon, aortic loop, or aortic cross-clamping). Then surgeon performed an upper segmental hysterotomy, avoiding the abnormal placenta invasion area; after that, the fetus was delivered, and the umbilical cord was ligated.After uterine exteriorization, the surgeon applies a continuous circular suture with number 2 polyglactin 910, taking some portions of the myometrium -to avoid unintentional slipping- around the lower uterine segment and a 3-4\\u2009cm proximal to the abnormal adhesion of the placenta. After tightening hard the circular suture, the uterine segment was circumferentially cut, three centimeters proximal to the circular hemostatic sutures. Next, the surgery follows the upper steps of conventional hysterectomy without changes. Additionally, the histological presence of fibrosis was examined in all samples. RESULTS: Modified subtotal hysterectomy in patients with PAS type 4 (cervical-trigonal fibrosis) resulted in a significant cl\u00ednico-surgical improvement over total hysterectomy. The median operative time and intraoperative bleeding were 140\\u2009min (IQR 90--240) and 1895\\u2009mL (IQR 1300-2500) in patients undergoing modified subtotal hysterectomy, and 260\\u2009min (IQR 210-287) and 2900\\u2009mL (IQR 2150-5500) in patients treated with total hysterectomy, respectively. The complication rate was 20% for MSHT and 82.3% for patients with a total hysterectomy.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Tosa residents (N = 239, 147 women, 23-74 years), free of anti-hypertensive medication, completed 7-day/24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. The circadian-circasemidian coupling was determined individually by computing the difference between the circadian phase and the circasemidian morning-phase of SBP. Participants were classified into three groups: those with a short coupling interval of about 4.5 hours (Group A), those with an intermediate coupling interval of about 6.0 hours (Group B), and those with a long coupling interval of about 8.0 hours (Group C). RESULTS: Residents of Group B who showed optimal circadian-circasemidian coordination had less pronounced morning and evening SBP surges, as compared to residents of Group A (10.82 vs 14.29 mmHg, P < 0.0001) and Group C (11.86 vs 15.21 mmHg, P < 0.0001), respectively.

Data related to demographics, presenting features, family history and coexistence of autoimmune diseases, physical examination findings, and biochemical progression over time were obtained. RESULTS: patients\u00b4 mean age at the diagnosis was 10.6 \u00b1 2.9 years, 80.8% (n = 59) of them were female and 83.6% (n = 61) were residing in iodine-sufficient areas. The commonest presenting features were thyromegaly and fatigability (79.5%, n = 58 and 43.8%, n = 32, respectively) after an illness duration of 0.5-48 months. Autoimmune comorbidities were documented in 8.2% (n = 6) of our series and more than half (53.4%, n = 39) of them were pre-pubertal at the diagnosis. Sixty point three percent (60.3%) (n = 44), 20.5% (n = 15), 13.7% (n = 10) and 5.5% (n = 4) of patients presented with overt hypothyroidism, sub-clinical hypothyroidism, euthyroidism and hyperthyroidism respectively, and there were no significant differences in the clinical profile between them. In patients' continued follow-up, 94.1% (n = 32/34) of those presented with overt hypothyroidism required levothyroxine therapy to maintain euthyroidism for 0.5-13 years, while 85.7% (n = 6/7) of those with euthyroidism remained so for 0.5-6 years. Remission was reported in all hyperthyroid patients and in only 5.9% (n = 2/34) of those with overt hypothyroidism at diagnosis. The majority of our patients with subclinical hypothyroidism were treated with levothyroxine and continued to be euthyroid for 10 months to 13 years.

Thus, we aimed to investigate the prevalence, risk factors and psychological status of COPD in Hongyuan County, Aba Prefecture, Sichuan Province, which is located at an average altitude of 3507 meters. METHODS: The 40 years old or greater permanent residents of Hongyuan County were selected by random sampling method, and the lung function test and questionnaires were conducted to determine the disease situation of COPD. The prevalence of COPD was compared among different factors of investigation, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for different factors to determine the independent influencing factors of COPD disease. RESULTS: A total of 456 permanent residents aged 40 years or older in Hongyuan County, 436 qualified for quality control, among which 53 cases confirmed COPD, the total prevalence was 12.16%, among which the prevalence was 14.55% for men and it was 8.07% for women.

Serum and salivary immunoglobulin heavy constant alpha 1 (IGHA1) are major markers of immunosuppression by HIE. Although much is known about the systemic immunosuppressive response, little is known about its local response in the oral cavity, lungs, bronchial tubes, and skin. The oral cavity allows bacteria or viruses to enter the body. Saliva covers the epidermis of the oral cavity and plays an important role in the local stress response by preventing infection. In this study, we examined the properties of saliva secreted during the local stress response for half-marathon (HM) induced IGHA1 protein expression using quantitative proteomics. METHODS: The Exercise Group (ExG) (19 healthy female university students) participated in a HM race. The Non-Exercise Group (NExG) (16 healthy female university students) did not participate in the ExG. The ExG saliva samples were collected 1 h pre and 2 h and 4 h post-HM. The NExG saliva samples were collected at the same time intervals. The saliva volume, protein concentration, and relative IGHA1 expression were analyzed. In addition, 1 h pre and 2 h post- HM saliva samples were analyzed by iTRAQ. The identified factors in iTRAQ were analyzed for the ExG and the NExG using western blotting. RESULTS: We identified kallikrein 1 (KLK1), immunoglobulin kappa chain (IgK), and cystatin S (CST4) as suppression factors, as well as IGHA1, which has been reported to be an immunological stress marker. IGHA1 (p = 0.003), KLK1 (p = 0.011), IGK (p = 0.002), and CST4 (p = 0.003) were suppressed 2 h post-HM compared with their levels pre HM, and IGHA1 (p < 0.001), KLK1 (p = 0.004), and CST4 (p = 0.006) were suppressed 4 h post-HM. There was also a positive correlation between IGHA1, IGK, and CST4 levels at 2 and 4 h post-HM. In addition, KLK1 and IGK levels at 2 h post-HM were positively correlated. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the salivary proteome is regulated, and antimicrobial proteins are suppressed post-HM. These results suggest that oral immunity was transiently suppressed post-HM. The positive correlation of each protein at 2 and 4 h post-HM suggests that the suppressed state was similarly regulated up to 4 h after a HM.

This study details the delivery of IMCI-based health care to 1,320 young infants and their mothers in a low-resource urban community in Lusaka, Zambia during 2015. Our Southern Africa Mother Infant Pertussis Study (SAMIPS) prospectively monitored a cohort of mother/infant pairs across infants' first four months of life, recording symptoms of respiratory infection and antibiotics prescriptions (predominantly penicillins), and tested nasopharyngeal (NP) samples for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Bordetella pertussis. Our retrospective analysis of the SAMIPS cohort found that symptoms and antibiotics use were more common in infants (43% and 15.7%) than in mothers (16.6% and 8%), while RSV and B. pertussis were observed at similar rates in infants (2.7% and 32.5%) and mothers (2% and 35.5%), albeit frequently at very low levels. In infants, we observed strong associations between symptoms, pathogen detection, and antibiotics use. Critically, we demonstrate that non-macrolide antibiotics were commonly prescribed for pertussis infections, some of which persisted across many weeks. We speculate that improved diagnostic specificity and/or clinician education paired with timely, appropriate treatment of pertussis could substantially reduce the burden of this disease while reducing the off-target use of penicillins.\") total:1606"]["('37193024', \"AB  - OBJECTIVE: Personality can influence how we interpret and react to our day-to-daylife circumstances. Temperament and character are the primary dimensions of personality, and both are influenced genetically. Temperament represents our emotional core, while character reflects our goals and values as we develop through life. Research shows that where people live, their social, economic, and physical environment can influence attitudes and behaviors, and these have links to variations in personality traits. There are few studies that focus on Australian personality as temperament and character. Using an Australian general population sample, we examined the psychometric properties of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCIR140) and investigated the associations between TCIR140 traits with both sociodemographic variables and measures of well-being. In addition, we investigated differences in temperament and character between our Australian general population sample and published results of similar studies from other countries. METHODS: Australians (N\\xa0=\\xa01,510) completed the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCIR-140), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Cronbach's alpha and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) examined the TCIR-140 psychometrics. Correlation analyzes, independent sample t-tests and ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons analyzed the sample. RESULTS: Cronbach's alphas were high, ranging from \u03b1\\xa0=\\xa00.78-0.92, and the CFA confirmed two constructs of temperament and character. Females were higher in Harm Avoidance (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), Reward Dependence (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), and Cooperativeness (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) compared to males, who were higher in Self-Directedness (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Age groups showed significant differences among all temperament and character traits (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) except for Reward Dependence (p\\xa0=\\xa00.690). Young adults had the least resilient personality profile and poorest measures of well-being. Correlations with measures of temperament and character, well-being and affect were all in the expected direction. CONCLUSIONS: Temperament and character are related to indicators of wellbeing and differs by age and sex. This Australian sample demonstrate a temperament that is high in Persistence and a character high in Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness with an overall postive affect and a general satisfaction with life. In comparison to other countries, Australians in this sample differ in levels of several traits, demonstrating a cautious and independent temperament with a character that is cooperative, industrious, and self-reliant. Young-adults in comparison to older groups have a temperament and character profile that is prone to negative emotions and a lower satisfaction with life.\") total:2769"]["('37192893', 'AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tamoxifen (TAM) has proven to be a therapeutic breakthrough toreduce mortality and recurrence in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. However, the application of TAM exhibits low bioavailability, off-target toxicity, instinct and acquired TAM resistance. METHODS: We utilized black phosphorus (BP) as a drug carrier and sonosensitizer, integrated with TAM and tumor-targeting ligand folic acid (FA) to construct TAM@BP-FA for synergistic endocrine and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) of breast cancer. The exfoliated BP nanosheets were modified through in situ polymerization of dopamine, followed by electrostatic adsorption of TAM and FA. The anticancer effect of TAM@BP-FA was evaluated through in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor model. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, flow cytometry analysis and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) analysis were performed for mechanism investigation. RESULTS: TAM@BP-FA had satisfactory drug loading capacity, the TAM release behavior can be controlled through pH microenvironment and ultrasonic stimulation. An amount of hydroxyl radical (\u2219OH) and singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) were as expected generated under ultrasound stimulation. TAM@BP-FA nanoplatform showed excellent internalization in both TAM-sensitive MCF7 and TAM-resistant (TMR) cells. Using TMR cells, TAM@BP-FA displayed significantly enhanced antitumor ability in comparison with TAM (7.7% vs 69.6% viability at 5\u03bcg/mL), the additional SDT further caused 15% more cell death. RNA-seq unraveled the TAM@BP-FA antitumor mechanisms including effects on cell cycle, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Further analysis showed additional SDT successfully triggering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) reduction. Moreover, PBMCs exposed to TAM@BP-FA induced an antitumor immune response by natural killer (NK) cell upregulation and immunosuppression macrophage reduction. CONCLUSION: The novel BP-based strategy not only delivers TAM specifically to tumor cells but also exhibits satisfactory antitumor effects through targeted therapy, SDT, and immune cell modulation.

SETTING: The health screening study was conducted between October 2019 and October 2021 in Western Area Urban, Sierra Leone. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2394 adult Sierra Leoneans aged 20 years or older were enrolled. OUTCOME MEASURE: Anthropometric data, fasting lipid profiles, fasting plasma glucose, TOD, clinical profiles and demographic characteristics of participants were described. The cardiometabolic risks were further related to TOD. RESULTS: The prevalence of known CMRFs was 35.3% for hypertension, 8.3% for diabetes mellitus, 21.1% for dyslipidaemia, 10.0% for obesity, 13.4% for smoking and 37.9% for alcohol. Additionally, 16.1% had left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by ECG, 14.2% had LVH by two-dimensional echo and 11.4% had chronic kidney disease (CKD). The odds of developing ECG-LVH were higher with diabetes (OR=1.255, 95%\\u2009CI (0.822 to 1.916) and dyslipidaemia (OR=1.449, 95%\\u2009CI (0.834 to 2.518). Associated factors for higher odds of Left Ventricular Mass Index by echo were dyslipidaemia (OR=1.844, 95%\\u2009CI (1.006 to 3.380)) and diabetes mellitus (OR=1.176, 95%\\u2009CI (0.759 to 1.823)).

Our study sought to assess knowledge of COVID-19 prevention behaviours, how these varied by socioeconomic (SEC) factors and the challenges of engagement and implementation, in two border counties of Kenya. METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods study using a household e-survey (Busia, N=294; Mandera, N=288; 57% females, 43% males), and qualitative telephone interviews (N=73: Busia 55; Mandera 18) with policy actors, healthcare workers, truckers and traders, and community members. Interviews were transcribed, English translated and analysed using the framework method. Associations between SEC (wealth quintiles, educational level) and knowledge of COVID-19 preventive behaviours were explored using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Participants were mostly educated to primary school level (54.4% Busia, 61.6% Mandera). Knowledge of COVID-19 prevention varied by behaviour: hand washing-86.5%, use of hand sanitiser-74.8%, wearing a face mask-63.1%, covering the mouth when sneezing or coughing-56.3% and social distancing-40.1%. Differences in knowledge by area, educational level and the wealth index were marked, greatest for Mandera, the less educated and the poor. Interviews with stakeholders revealed challenges in health messaging, psychosocial and socioeconomic factors, lack of preparedness for truck border crossings, language barrier, denial and livelihood insecurity as key challenges to engagement with and implementation of COVID-19 prevention behaviours in the border regions. CONCLUSION: The influence of SEC disparities and border dynamics on knowledge and engagement with COVID-19 prevention behaviours calls for contextually appropriate risk communication strategies that are cognisant of community needs and local patterns of information flow. Coordinating response measures across border points is crucial in winning communities' trust and maintaining essential economic and social activities.\") total:2204"]["('37192799', 'AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compile the currently availableevidence on the clinical characteristics of the locomotive syndrome (LS) categorised by the 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale (GLFS-25) and clarify its clinical usefulness for assessing mobility function.

More participants in the spironolactone group reported acne improvement than in the placebo group: no significant difference was reported at week 12 (72% v 68%, odds ratio 1.16 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.91)) but significant difference was noted at week 24 (82% v 63%, 2.72 (1.50 to 4.93)). Treatment success (IGA classified) at week 12 was 31 (19%) of 168 given spironolactone and nine (6%) of 160 given placebo (5.18 (2.18 to 12.28)). Adverse reactions were slightly more common in the spironolactone group with more headaches reported (20% v 12%; p=0.02). No serious adverse reactions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone improved outcomes compared with placebo, with greater differences at week 24 than week 12. Spironolactone is a useful alternative to oral antibiotics for women with acne. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN12892056.\") total:2722"]["('37192669', 'AB  - Phenotypes are partly shaped by the environment, which can impact both short-termadaptation and long-term evolution. In dioecious species, the two sexes may exhibit different degrees of phenotypic plasticity and theoretical models indicate that such differences may confer an adaptive advantage when the population is subject to directional selection, either because of a systematically varying environment or a load of deleterious mutations. The effect stems from the fundamental asymmetry between the two sexes: female fertility is more limited than male fertility. Whether this asymmetry is sufficient for sexual dimorphism in phenotypic plasticity to evolve is, however, not obvious. Here, we show that even in conditions where it provides an adaptive advantage, dimorphic phenotypic plasticity may be evolutionarily unstable due to sexual selection. This is the case, in particular, for panmictic populations where mating partnerships are formed at random. However, we show that the effects of sexual selection can be counteracted when mating occurs within groups of related individuals. Under this condition, sexual dimorphism in phenotypic plasticity can not only evolve but offset the twofold cost of males. We demonstrate these points with a simple mathematical model through a combination of analytical and numerical results.') total:1341"]["('37192648', 'AB  - The objective is to examine the separate and joint effects of dynapenia andabdominal obesity on the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in older adults of different ages (60-74 and over 75 years old). This study comprised 1293 community-dwelling Chinese participants recruited from Shanghai, China, who were aged at least 60 years (753 women; mean age: 72.0\\u2009\u00b1\\u20095.9 years). Dynapenia was defined as low-grip strength (<28.0\\u2005kg for males and <18.0\\u2005kg for females) but normal skeletal muscle index (\u22657.0\\u2005kg/m(2) for males and \u22655.7\\u2005kg/m(2) for females). Abdominal obesity was determined according to waist circumference (\u226590\\u2005cm for males and \u226585\\u2005cm for females), and PAD was diagnosed by an ankle-brachial index \\u2009\u2264\\u20090.9. Binary logistic regression models were performed to determine associations between dynapenia, abdominal obesity, and the combination of dynapenia and abdominal obesity and PAD. According to dynapenia and abdominal obesity status stratified by age (60-74 or over 75), the patients were divided into 4 groups: normal, dynapenia alone, abdominal obesity alone, and co-occurring groups. A logistic regression showed that the co-occurring groups (odds ratio\\u2009=\\u20094.63, 95% confidence interval\\u2009=\\u20091.41-15.21) had a higher prevalence of PAD than the normal group after adjusting for the covariates in older adults over 75 years of age. The combination of dynapenia and abdominal obesity increase the prevalence of PAD in older adults over 75 years. The present findings have important implications for the early identification of older adults with PAD and appropriate interventions should be implemented.') total:1624"]["('37192536', 'AB  - BACKGROUND: After COVID-19 infection, individuals can experience a variety ofsymptoms that might require further treatment. Early data showed the value of adapted pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and technology-based interventions. To develop appropriate services, it is important to understand the symptom burden and the preferred mode of rehabilitation delivery. METHODS: Post-hospital discharge (H) and post-community-managed (C) individuals received a follow-up call. A survey was completed to assess the most burdensome symptoms for which the patients would require support and their preference for the mode of rehabilitation delivery. RESULTS: Overall, 160 individuals who received a follow-up call completed the survey (51.2% male, mean [SD] age 54 [15] years) and 126 (78.8%) were post-hospital, while 34 (21.3%) had community-managed infections. A total of 101 (63.1%) reported that COVID-19-related symptoms were affecting their daily activities, and 106 (66.3%) reported their desire to be more active. The most common symptoms identified as needing support were fatigue and shortness of breath. Both groups expressed a preference for a face-to-face group programme (C: 54.8%; H: 46.8%), while (38.7%) of post-community-managed individuals and (40.3%) post-hospital patients preferred a supported digital rehabilitation programme. Few opted a non-digital home-based programme (C: 3.2%; H:12.9%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The survey responses indicated a significant symptom burden that may benefit from an intervention such as rehabilitation. Preferences for rehabilitation indicated that a face-to-face intervention was preferred by the majority, with a large proportion preferring digital intervention.') total:1725"]["('37192506', 'AB  - BACKGROUND: previous studies have focused on the risk of cardiovascular disease(CVD)-related death in individual cancers, adolescents or all cancers. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the risk of CVD-related death in older patients with cancer. METHODS: older patients with cancer (over 65\\xa0years) of 16 cancers diagnosed between 1975 and 2018 were screened out from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program. The proportion of deaths, competing risk regression models, standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were used to assess the risk of CVD-related death. RESULTS: this study included 1,141,675 older patients (median follow-up: 13.5\\xa0years). Of the 16 individual cancers, the risk of CVD death exceeded primary neoplasm death in older patients with cancers of the breast, endometrium, vulva, prostate gland, penis and melanoma of the skin over time (high competing risk group). Compared to the general older population, older patients with cancer had higher SMR and AER of CVD-related death (SMR: 1.58-4.23; AER: 21.16-365.89), heart disease-related death (SMR: 1.14-4.16; AER: 16.29-301.68) and cerebrovascular disease-related death (SMR: 1.11-4.66; AER: 3.02-72.43), with the SMR trend varying with CVD-related death competing risk classifications. The risk of CVD-related death in the high-competing risk group was higher than in the low-competing risk group. CONCLUSIONS: for older patients with cancer, six of 16 individual cancers, including breast, endometrium, vulva, prostate gland, penis and melanoma of the skin was at high risk of CVD-related death. Management for long-term cardiovascular risk in older patients with cancer is needed.') total:1689"]
