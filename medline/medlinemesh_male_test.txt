      DS carcinosarcoma. Stimulation of the autoimmune activity for approx. 20 days
      by BA 1, a N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea. Novel prophylactic possibilities].
PG  - 1369-79
AB  - A report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties
      in BA 1 [N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea] having a (low) molecular mass M = 111.104.
      Experiments in 214 DS carcinosarcoma bearing Wistar rats have shown that BA
      1, at a dosage of only about 12 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) and negligible lethality
      (1.7 percent), results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia
      and, in one test, of 80 percent with hyperglycemia. Under otherwise unchanged
      conditions the reference substance ifosfamide (IF) -- a further development
      of cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage
      of 47 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at
      a lethality of 18 percent. (Contrary to BA 1, 250-min hyperglycemia caused no
      further improvement of the recovery rate.) However this comparison is characterized
      by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different (complementary)
      mechanisms of action. Leucocyte counts made after application of the said cancerostatics
      and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with BA 1 and with ifosfamide,
      the known suppression in the post-therapeutic interval usually found with standard
      cancerostatics. In combination with the cited plaque test for BA 1, blood pictures
      then allow conclusions on the immunity status. Since IF can be taken as one
      of the most efficient cancerostatics--there is no other chemotherapeutic known
      up to now that has a more significant effect on the DS carcinosarcoma in rats
      -- these findings are of special importance. Finally, the total amount of leucocytes
      and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood
      picture of tumour-free rats after i.v. application of BA 1. The thus obtained
      numerical values clearly show that further research work on the prophylactic
      use of this substance seems to be necessary and very promising.

TI  - Pharmacological properties of new neuroleptic compounds.
PG  - 1436-42
AB  - RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are newly synthetized N-[8-R-dibenzo(b,f)oxepin-10-yl]-N'-methyl-piperazine-maleates
      which show interesting psychopharmacologic effects. This work contains the results
      of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their
      neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and chlordiazepoxide
      (CPD). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds
      reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant
      activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable
      eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on
      electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds
      show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a
      strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an antiaggressive effect and
      an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than CPZ. We have
      also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers
      of the kind of the standards used by us. As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds
      show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably
      due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of
      adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions
      (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61
      280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those
      of CPZ. Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are
      similar to CPZ, although with less effect on dopamine level.

PG  - 1460-3
AB  - A double-blind study with intra-individual comparisons was carried out to investigate
      the effects of 15 mg of (8r)-3alpha-hydroxy-8-isopropyl-1alphaH-tropanium bromide(+/-)-tropate
      (Sch 1000), 15 mg Sch 1000 + 10 mg oxazepam, 10 mg oxazepam and placebo with
      oral administration in randomized sequence on gastric juice volume, amount of
      acid, concentration and pH values in 12 healthy volunteers. The secretion parameters
      were measured during a 1-h basal period and a 2-h stimulation period. The gastric
      juice was obtained in 15 min portions via stomach tube. Stimulation was effected
      by 1 mug/kg/h pentagastrin via drip infusion. The Friedman test was used for
      the comparative statistical evaluation, and individual comparisons were carried
      out by means of the Wilcoxon test (pair-differences rank). The results show
      that Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated
      secretion volume. As compared with placebo, it was not possible to establish
      an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone. Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam
      were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid, while oxazepam
      reduced this quantity only during the first 30 min of basal secretion. None
      of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid,
      although both Sch 1000 preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean
      values. During the basal secretion period, all three test preparations had an
      inhibiting action on acid concentration, but none of them had a significant
      effect during the stimulation period. The pH value was savely increased only
      by Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam, and this even only during the basal period.
      The results are discussed.

      rabbit liver microsomes.
PG  - 249-57
AB  - Rabbit liver microsomal preparations fortified with 0.1 mM NADPH effectively
      promote hydroxylation of [3beta-3H]- or [24-14C]allochenodeoxycholic acid or
      [5alpha,6alpha-3H2]5alpha-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha-diol to their respective
      12alpha-hydroxyl derivatives in yields of about 25 or 65% in 60 min. Minor amounts
      of other products are formed from the diol. The requirements for activity of
      rabbit liver microsomal 12alpha-hydroxylase resemble those of rat liver microsomes.
      Of a number of enzyme inhibitors studied only p-chloromercuribenzoate demonstrated
      a marked ability to inhibit the reaction with either tritiated substrate. There
      was no difference in the quantity of product produced from the tritiated acid
      or the 14C-labeled acid. No clear sex difference was found in activity of the
      enzyme, nor was an appreciable difference noted in activity of the enzyme between
      mature and immature animals.

      of rat liver.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Properties of the phenobarbital induced cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC
      1.2.1.3) have been studied in rat liver. 7-12-Fold higher levels were seen in
      the cytoplasmic activities after phenobarbital treatment in reactor compared
      to non-reactor animals with high concentrations of acetaldehyde (18 mM) and
      propionaldehyde (9 mM). No difference was found with 0.12 mM acetaldehyde, 2
      mM glycolaldehyde, 6 mM formaldehyde or 0.5 mM betaine aldehyde. The reactor
      group also had slightly higher activity in the mitochondrial fraction with the
      high acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde concentrations. In the microsomal fraction,
      the activities showed no differences at any substrate concentration. An induced
      aldehyde dehydrogenase was purified 70-fold by chromatographic techniques. It
      had different molecular and enzymic properties than the main high-Km enzyme
      normally present in rat liver cytoplasm. The pI of the induced enzyme was about
      7.0 as measured by isoelectric focusing. It was active with several aliphatic
      and aromatic aldehydes but not with formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde or D-glyceraldehyde.
      The Km-values for propionaldehyde and acetaldehyde were in the millimolar range.
      Millimolar concentrations of aromatic aldehydes caused a strong substrate inhibition.
      The enzyme was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of disulfiram. Estrone,
      deoxycorticosterone, progesterone and diethylstilbestrol also affected the enzyme
      activity.

TI  - Studies on rat renal cortical cell kallikrein. I. Separation and measurement.
PG  - 305-15
AB  - A technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a heterogeneous
      population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension. After rat kidneys were
      perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats, viable, counted cortical cell suspensions
      were obtained. Cells were suspended in a sucrose/Tris buffer containing 0.5%
      deoxycholate, homogenized, centrifuged, dialyzed, and gel filtered on Sephadex
      G-25. Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose resulted in a single peak of esterase
      activity between 0.20 to 0.25 M NaCl/sodium phosphate buffer. Subsequent elution
      yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to kallikrein isolated from
      rat urine, insofar as pH optimum, effects of inhibitors, bioassay activity and
      immunological properties were concerned. Calculated yields were about 70% of
      the total esterase activity present in the parent cell homogenates. Recoveries
      of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell homogenates, the DEAE-cellulose
      columns, or the eluates from the columns ranged from 83-108% (mean 96%). Using
      this technique, it was found that the amount of kallikrein activity present
      in non-incubated renal cortical cells ranged from 0.6-10(-2) to 4.6 - 10(-2)
      alpha-N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (Tos-Arg-OMe) esterase units per 10(8)
      cells. However, cells incubated in a nutrient medium at 37 degrees C for 3-8
      h contained no measurable kallikrein activity, whereas the surrounding medium
      had kallikrein activity which could be significantly increased by aldosterone
      and decreased by spironolactone.

TI  - N-terminal spin label studies of hemoglobin, Ligand and pH dependence.
PG  - 187-93
AB  - Human hemoglobin was spin labeled with 4-isothiocanato-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperdinooxyl,
      which is known to bind specifically to the N-terminal alpha-amino groups of
      proteins and slightly to the reactive sulfhydryl groups. Electron spin resonance
      (ESR) analysis indicated a partially resolved five-line spectrum, suggesting
      that the label was attached to at least two different binding sites. Using specific
      blocking reagents prior to spin labeling, the two binding sites were attributed
      to the sulfhydryl group of beta-93 (immobile) and the alpha-amino group of the
      N-terminal valines (mobile). The relative motion of the spin at one set of binding
      sites was restricted regardless of the state of ligation and pH, while the motion
      at the other site showed dependence on those parameters, e.g. the spin-labeled
      N-terminal ends of deoxyhemoglobin have restricted motion at all pH ranges studied,
      while those of oxyhemoglobin are relatively free to move at the basic pH range,
      but become more restricted in the acidic pH range.

AB  - Hb-Manitoba was discovered in 1970 [1] in a Canadian family of British origin.
      Recently we observed the same variant in a second family, and found that the
      oxy-derivative of Hb-Manitoba is slightly unstable at 65 degrees C, dissociates
      less readily at alkaline pH than does Hb-A, and forms asymmetric hybrids with
      other hemoglobins which are readily detectable by electrophoresis.

AB  - Chronic experiments were conducted on rats and rabbits; a study was made of
      the effect of carbidine on the conditioned defence reflexes in stimulation of
      the mesencephalic part of the reticular formation. Carbidine prevented the depression
      of the conditioned defence reflexes caused by stimulation of the mesencephalic
      portion of the reticular formation. This pointed to its depressive influence
      on the mentioned structures, and was confirmed by experiments on rabbits in
      recording changes in biocurrents under conditions of stimulation of the mesencephalic
      reticular formation.

PG  - 68-71
AB  - It was shown in acute experiments on rats that one hour after an intraperitoneal
      injection of theophylline (50 mg/kg) there was a decrease in the NAD + NADP
      content by 19.4%, a tendency to a fall of NAD.H2 + NADP.H2 was expressed, and
      the total nicotinamide coferment level was reduced. A tendency to decrease NAD
      + NADP and the total pyridine nucleotide level was seen after caffeine administration.
      The action of catecholamines and methylxanthines was compared. Theobromine produced
      no significant effect on the indices under study. It was shown that isadrine
      decreased the NAD + NADP level; adrenaline (25 mkg/kg) increased the content
      of both the oxidized (by 24%) and of the reduced (by 48%) forms of pyridine
      nucleotides. An increase of adrenaline dose to 1000 mkg/kg was accompanied by
      reduction of the oxidized forms (by 22.2%) and of the total nicotinamide coferment
      level (by 18%).

TI  - The importance of an innervated and intact antrum and pylorus in preventing
      postoperative duodenogastric reflux and gastritis.
PG  - 845-9
AB  - This study has investigated the relationship between duodenogastric reflux,
      gastritis and certain symptoms 6-12 months after three operations for uncomplicated
      duodenal ulcer. The operations studied were proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV,
      20 cases), truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty (TV+P, 22 cases) and truncal vagotomy
      and antrectomy (TV+A, 21 cases). Duodenogastric reflux was assessed both by
      a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of bilirubin in
      the gastric aspirate before and after operation. Incidence and severity of postoperative
      gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy. Symptoms were assessed by symptomatic
      score and Visick grading. There was a significant correlation between duodenal
      reflux and histological evidence of both severe superficial gastritis and glandular
      atrophy (P less than 0-01). There was also a close association between the degree
      of reflux and the presence of severe heartburn, epigastric pain and bile vomiting
      after operation. The amount of reflux did not differ before operation. There
      was significantly less reflux following PGV than after either TV+P (P less than
      0-025) or TV+A (P less than 0-001). The results indicate that an operation which
      preserves an innervated and intact antrum and pylorus will protect against postoperative
      duodenogastric reflux, gastritis and symptoms.

TI  - Haemoglobin Rahere (beta Lys-Thr): A new high affinity haemoglobin associated
      with decreased 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate binding and relative polycythaemia.
PG  - 200-2
AB  - A new haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity, beta82 (EF6) lysine leads
      to threonine (Hb Rahere), was found during the investigation of a patient who
      was found to have a raised haemoglobin concentration after a routine blood count.
      The substitution affects one of the 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate binding sites, resulting
      in an increased affinity for oxygen, but both the haem-haem interaction and
      the alkaline Bohr effect are normal in the haemolysate. This variant had the
      same mobility as haemoglobin A on electrophoresis at alkaline pH but was detected
      by measuring the whole blood oxygen affinity; it could be separated from haemoglobin
      A, however, by electrophoresis in agar at acid pH. The raised haemoglobin concentration
      was mainly due to a reduction in plasma volume (a relative polycythaemia) and
      was associated with a persistently raised white blood count. This case emphasises
      the need to measure the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin in all patients with
      absolute or relative polycythaemia when some obvious cause is not evident.

PG  - 371-4
AB  - Endoscopic papillotomy was attempted in 59 patients with extrahepatic obstruction
      of the biliary duct system and was actually performed in 50 patients. A special
      high-frequency diathermy knife was introduced via a duodenoscope into the terminal
      common bile duct and the roof of the papilla was incised. In 33 out of 39 patients
      with choledocholithiasis the stones passed into the duodenum spontaneously or
      were removed endoscopically. Papillary stenosis without ductal stones was successfully
      treated with this method in eight out of 11 patients. One perforation of the
      duodenocholedochal junction occurred and was repaired surgically. Endoscopic
      papillotomy and stone extraction is a relatively safe and effective method of
      treating extrahepatic jaundice.

      were studied in 25 mongrel dogs prepared by surgically implanting a plastic
      encased non-ferrous core electromagnetic probe on the ascending aorta. The findings
      are: (1) Metabolic acidaemia produced only slight decrease in cardiac output
      but a more marked fall became evident with decreasing pH(2) Respiratory acidaemia
      led to a slight rise in cardiac output. (3) Respiratory alkalaemia decreased
      cardiac output. (4) Metabolic alkalaemia also produced a decline in cardiac
      output.

      space of fetal lambs.
PG  - 726-33
AB  - Mock cerebrospinal fluid (pH 5.37-8.38) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) (0.15-1.5
      mg) was injected into the subarachnoid space of the ventral brain stem of exteriorized
      fetal sheep. Changes in pH on the ventral surface of the medulla did not stimulate
      respiratory efforts or induce significant cardiovascular changes. The respiratory
      response to DNP injections ranged from no response to prolonged rhythmic ventilation
      that was independent of the peripheral chemoreceptors or the control arterial
      pH and blood gas tensions. This inconsistency suggests an effector site somewhat
      removed from the immediate surface of the medulla. The heart rate and blood
      pressure were not affected. It is concluded that increased H+ concentration
      in the extracellular fluid of the fetal ventral medulla does not initiate respiration,
      and any respiratory response to metabolic inhibitors applied to this area therefore
      is not attributable to a secondary change in surface pH.

TI  - The effects of the continuous administration of N,N-dimethyl-4-phenylazoaniline
      (DAB) on the activities and the inducibilities of some drug-metabolizing enzymes
      in rat liver.
PG  - 313-28
AB  - (1) The effect of feeding a relatively low-protein diet containing 0.06% DAB
      for 29 weeks on the activity of DAB-azoreductase, nitroreductase (p-nitrobenzoic
      acid), N-oxidase (N,N-dimethylaniline), N-demethylase (DAB), cytochrome P-450,
      NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, beta-glucuronidase and arylsulphatase A were studied.
      Rapid decreases occurred in the activities of the first six enzymes, reaching
      minimal values at between 4 and 8 weeks. Activities then increased in all cases
      to control or nearly control levels. This rate of increase was least for cytochrome
      P-450. At 4 weeks azoreductase activity with the chemotherapeutic agent CB10-252
      (I) as substrate was significantly higher than in control rats. Early increases
      occurred in the activities of beta-glucuronidase and arylsulphatase A and the
      activity of the latter never dropped below the control level. (2) An investigation
      was made of the differential effects of dye feeding on some of the enzyme activities
      in the two major liver lobes and differences were found. (3) The effect of phenobarbital
      (PB) pretreatment on the DAB-fed rats was studied at 4-week intervals. The activities
      of DAB-azoreductase and of nitroreductase increased throughout the whole period,
      while the activities of the lysosomal enzymes were decreased. (4) After feeding
      DAB for 4 weeks the effect of PB and 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) on the activities
      of DAB-azoreductase, CB10-252-azoreductase and components of the azoreductases-cytochrome
      P-450, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, the CO-CB10-252-azoreductase was not induced
      by PB or MC, and CO did not inhibit its reduction. Its reduction depended only
      slightly on NADH. CO caused a greater relative decrease in the activity of DAB-azoreductase
      in dye-fed animals and also in animals following PB and MC pretreatment, implying
      a greater role of cytochrome P-450 in dye-fed animals.

TI  - Some characteristics of two azoreductase systems in rat liver. Relevance to
      the activity of 2-[4'-di(2"-bromopropyl)-aminophenylazo]benzoic acid (CB10-252),
      a compound possessing latent cytotoxic activity.
PG  - 329-42
AB  - The system involved in the reduction of 2-[4'-di(2''-bromopropyl) aminophenylazolbenzoic
      acid (CB10-252), an agent designed for treating primary liver cell cancer, has
      been demonstrated to be localised mainly in the 108 000 X g supernatant fraction
      of rat liver homogenate. It is also present in other organs particularly in
      the spleen. DAB-azoreductase as shown previously is present almost entirely
      in the microsomal fraction and is found in high concentration only in liver.
      The pH maximum for CB10-252-azoreductase implying the importance of the 2'-carboxyl
      group in determining substrate specificity. The use of enzyme inhibitors and
      other additives showed that CB10-252 WAS NOT AXANTHINE OXIDASE OR DIHYDROFOLATE
      REDUCTASE. Its activity was not affected by carbon monoxide, phenobarbitone
      (PB), or 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) pretreatment. Enhancement of the activity
      by ferrous ions and FAD indicated that at least part of the reduction system
      could involve a flavoprotein with FAD as the prosthetic group. The activity
      of CB10-252-azoreductase and methylred-azoreductase was reduced by menadione

TI  - Effect of coronary blood flow on glycolytic flux and intracellular pH in isolated
      rat hearts.
PG  - 733-41
AB  - The rate of coronary blood flow was varied in isolated working rat heart preparations
      to determine its influence on the rate of glocose utilization, tissue high-energy
      phosphates, and intracellular pH. A 60% reduction in coronary blood flow resulted
      in a 30% reduction in oxygen consumption, an accelerated rate of glusoe utilization,
      lower tissue levels of high-energy phosphate, and higher tissue levels of lactate
      and H+. Ventricular performance deteriorated as reflected by a decrease in heart
      rate and peak systolic pressure. Further reductions in coronary blood flow resulted
      in inhibition of glycolysis, a greater decrease in tissue levels of high-energy
      phosphates, and higher tissue levels of both lactate and H+. These changes in
      glycolytic flux, tissue metabolites, and ventricular performance were proportional
      to the degree of restriction in coronary blood flow. The importance of coronary
      blood flow and washout of the interstitial space in the maintenance of accelerated
      glycolytic flux in oxygen-deficient hearts is emphasized. It is concluded that
      acceleration of ATP production from glycolysis can occur only in the marginally
      ischemic tissue in the peripheral area of tissue supplied by an occluded artery.
      The central area of tissue which receives a low rate of coronary blood flow
      will have a reduced rate of ATP production due to both a lack of oxygen and
      an inhibition of glycolysis.

TI  - Mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic rat hearts.
PG  - 742-51
AB  - The mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic myocardium were investigated
      in the isolated, perfused rat heart. Glycolysis was inhibited at the level of
      glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The major factors that accounted for
      the glycolytic inhibition in the ischemic heart compared with the anoxic heart
      appeared to be higher tissue levels of lactate and H+ in the ischemic tissue.
      Increased extracellular pH inhibited glycolysis in anoxic and hypoxic hearts
      much more readily than it did in aerobic hearts. However, maintenance of both
      extracellular and intracellular pH caused only a modest acceleration of glycolysis
      in ischemic hearts. Accumulation of tissue lactate and inhibition of glycolysis
      were directly proportional to the reduction in coronary bloow flow in both anoxic
      and ischemic hearts. At intracellular lactate concentrations between 15 and
      20 mM, glycolysis was inhibited under both conditions. Addition of either 10,
      20, or 40 mM lactate to the perfusate inhibited glycolysis in aerobic, anoxic,
      and ischemic hearts. The effect of lactate did not appear to be mediated through
      changes in intracellular pH. It is concluded that accumulation of lactate represents
      a major factor in the inhibition of glycolysis that develops in ischemic hearts.

TI  - Comparison of contractile performance of canine atrial and ventricular muscles.
PG  - 762-71
AB  - This study compared the contractile performance of a canine right atrial trabecula
      with that of a macroscopically indistinguishable trabecula isolated from the
      right ventricular apex. The heart was removed from nine mongrel puppies weighing
      6-8 kg and placed in Krebs-Ringer's bicarbonate solution. The bathing solution
      contained only 1.25 mmoles of Ca2+ and was bubbled with a 95% O2-5% CO2 gas
      mixture. Each atrial trabecula was specially selected from the right atrial
      appendage. Histologically, these trabeculae showed a remarkable longitudinal
      orientation of the fibers. At Lmax (the length of the muscle at which developed
      tension was maximum) under identical conditions of temperature, rate of stimulation,
      ionic milieu, pH, and O2 and CO2 supply, right atrial trabeculae achieved the
      same developed and total tensions but in a much shorter time than did ventricular
      trabeculae. In both muscle groups the maximum developed tension averaged about
      2.5 g/mm2. Since Lo (expressed as a fraction of Lmax) was less in atrial muscle
      than it was in ventribular muscle, we concluded that atrial muscle can be stretched
      considerably more than can ventricular muscle before optimum length is reached.
      At any given initial muscle length, the maximum of tension rise for atrial trabeculae
      amounted to at least twice that for ventricular trabeculae. At any given load
      up to 1.5 g/mm2, the maximum velocity of shortening of an atrial trabecula was
      about three to four times that of a ventricular trabecula. These results collectively
      indicate that the contractile performance of the right atrial muscle is in many
      respects superior to that of the right ventricle, at least under the conditions
      of these experiments.

PG  - 503-6
AB  - 1. We measured the minute ventilation and arterial blood catecholamine concentrations
      in four normal men standing and at two levels of moderate treadmill exercise
      breathing 14% oxygen or air. 2. Minute ventilation was significantly higher
      during hypoxic exercise than during normoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of
      1500 ml/min. 3. Arterial plasma noradrenaline during hypoxic exercise at an
      oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min was significantly greater than at rest. 4. Arterial
      plasma noradrenaline during normoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min
      was not elevated above the resting concentration. 5. The results are compatible
      with the suggestion that increased concentrations of arterial plasma noradrenaline
      contribute to the hypoxic potentiation of the respiratory response to moderate
      exercise.

      the pH optima of GT (7.5) and betaG (4.5). The activities of the two enzymes
      were compared using microsomes from rats, mice, pigs, cattle and horses, with
      pNP, pNPGA, and phenolphthalein as substrate, in the presence of various cofactors
      and inhibitors at pH 7.5 and 4.5. These data disclose pronounced differences
      with respect to species, substrate and other experimental conditions, thereby
      precluding the establishment of general optimum conditions. The two enzymes
      were also assayed under strictly identical conditions using pNP and pNPGA and
      rat liver microsomes at pH 7.5 in the presence and absence of UDP-glucuronate
      disodium (UDPGA), activators (ATP;UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) and inhibitors. When
      provided with a functional level of UDPGA, both enzymes proved active under
      those conditions, and a conjugation-deconjugation interplay was indicated. The
      two processes could be selectively and totally inhibited by Zn2+ and saccharolactone.
      The results suggest that conjugation-deconjugation-reconjugation cycles may
      be operative in the metabolism of drugs in vivo, taking place already at the
      level of the liver endoplasmic reticulum.

      activity. I. Experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in rabbits.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Serum, liver and renal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activities were studied
      in four groups of rabbits: controls, rabbits with obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis,
      rabbits with obstructive anuria, and animals with combined obstructive extrahepatic
      cholestasis and obstructive anuria. Serum GGT was essentially increased in rabbits
      with obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis, showing peak values in the combined
      cholestasis + obstructive anuria group, and practically normal values in animals
      with anuria. Liver GGT was increased in both cholestasis groups, but the increase
      was less prominent than the increase in serum GGT and there was no correlation
      between them. In both anuric groups renal GGT was reduced, probably as a result
      of inhibited enzyme synthesis secondary to the altered conditions for adequate
      renal function. The results obtained are suggestive of a probable renal involvement
      in the formation of the serum GGT activity level.

AB  - In white rats both adapted and unadapted to cold, the RQ dynamics during cold
      exposure, noradrenaline and ganglion blocking agent administration, were studied.
      The adapted animals' RQ in thermoneutral conditions was shown to be a little
      higher than in the control rats; 0.5 mg/kg noradrenaline injections induced
      a clear RQ decrease in the former and did not influence the latters' RQ. Cold
      exposure was followed by a RQ decrease in both. Ganglion blocking agent administration
      decreased the RQ in the adapted animals and prevented it from falling in the
      control those. Noradrenaline is supposed to be the main but not the only factor
      activating lipolysis in the cold adapted animals.

PG  - 405-14
AB  - Adrenaline-induced gastric ulceration was studied in rats. Adrenaline in high
      doses caused gastric ulcer, which was completely blocked by pretreatment with
      alpha-blockers (phenoxybenzamine, dibenamine), but not by pretreatment with
      propranolol or atropine, nor by vagotomy, hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy. After
      successive administration of adrenaline, once daily for 7 days, however, no
      gastric ulcer was observed. Recovery from the ulcerogenic action of adrenaline
      was seen after 4 weeks withdrawal. Pretreatment with a small dose of adrenaline
      inhibited the ulcerogenic action of a high dose of adrenaline. Pretreatment
      with reserpine, pyrogallol or iproniazid inhibited the action of adrenaline.
      It is concluded that adrenaline has a biphasic effect on gastric ulceration,
      the ulcerogenic action is due to its alpha-action and antiulcerogenic effect
      is due to development of tachyphylaxis.

PG  - 415-26
AB  - Adrenaline and isoproterenol elicited nearly maximal relaxation of the colon
      even in small doses, whereas increase in the doses caused greater relaxation
      in the duodenum. In the colon, these drugs prevented, to a great extent the
      contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin but in the duodenum
      were totally ineffective. Dibenamine and propranolol reduced adrenaline- and
      isoproterenol-induced relaxation in the duodenum, though propranolol decreased
      the relaxation caused by isoproterenol. Atropine prevented ACh-induced contraction
      in both the colon and duodenum in the same way. After 2-bromolysergic acid diethylamide,
      duodenal contraction caused by ACh or serotonin decreased by over 70%; however,
      the contraction of the colon was not significantly inhibited. Methysergide had
      similar effects, but to a lesser degree. In calcium-free bathing fluid without
      addition of Na2EDTA, ACh and prostaglandin E1 elicited contraction in the colon,
      but not in the duodenum.

TI  - [Combined use of bucolome and pyrazolone derivatives (1). Pharmacological activities
      and blood concentration].
PG  - 609-29
AB  - A combination of two or more drugs may exert a drug-drug interaction, in which
      case the effect can be potentiated or antagonized. Such synergistic effects
      are well known in the case of pyrabital (barbital + aminopyrine) or irgapyrine
      (phenylbutazone + aminopyrine). Bucolome (BCP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      agent, has the chemical structure of a barbiturate and also resembles the formula
      of pheylbutazone. Thus the influence of BCP combination on the pharmacological
      activities of various pyrazolone derivatives was examined. BCP potentiated the
      analgesic and antipyretic effects of 4-aminoantipyrine (4A), methylaminoantipyrine
      (MA), aminopyrine (AM) and isopropylaminoantipyrine (IPA), which were substituted
      by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring. This potentiation
      occurred when the dose of BCP exceeded that of the pyrazolones, and was especially
      marked when combination ratio of BCP exceeded that of the pyrazolones, and was
      especially marked when combination ratio of BCP and pyrazolone was 2:1 mola.
      The analgesic effects of antipyrine (AN), isopropylantipyrine (IP) and aminopropylone
      (AP), which were substituted by alkyl group or aminoacylamino group at 4-position,
      were not potentiated by BCP in any combination ratio. Most pyrazolones showed
      additive acute toxicity in their combination with BCP, but acute toxicities
      of 4A and AM, which were potentiated in analgesic effects, were decreased and
      antagonized when combined with BCP. The plasma concentration of AM was increased
      and prolonged by BCP, while that of IP remained much the same. These results
      suggest that the pharmacological activities are associated with certain molecular
      interactions between BCP and pyrazolones, which are substituted by the alkylamino
      group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring.

TI  - [Studies on low volume priming heart lung bypass (author's transl)].
PG  - 137-67
AB  - This report concerns the feasibility of low volume priming extracorporeal circulation.
      Through this study, the bubble oxygenator with Zuhdi's heat exchange was used.
      Moderate hypothermia with surface cooling and hemodilution perfusion with 5
      per cent D/W was evaluated in 32 mongrel dogs and 16 clinical open heart cases.
      The results obtained here were as follow: 1) Body temperature reduction by surface
      cooling before bypass provided more even cooling than did core cooling by low
      flow partial bypass alone. 2) In regard to cardiac loading on returning the
      whole perfusate of the circuit to patient, approximately 20 ml/kg of 5 per cent
      D/W was feasible as a priming solution. 3) To reduce the blood visicosity, hemodilution
      technique with 5 per cent D/W was superior, and hemodilution effect during postoperative
      periods was temporaly. 4) The excess lactate volume postulated by Huckabee was
      a available index to evaluate metabolic acidosis during the extracorporeal circulation.
      5) With aid of surface cooling, the acid-base balance during perfusion was kept
      to lesser extent than that of core cooling only. 6) This study indicated that
      the low priming perfusion in conjunction with surface cooling hypothermia was
      a reliable technique for the open heart operation and may be applied in more
      prolonged perfusion.

AB  - The kinetics and cellular characteristics of immunosuppression in (CBA-p X C57/Bl)F1
      mice during graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction induced with spleen cells from
      either parental strain have been investigated. Effects on PFC responses to thymus-dependent
      (chicken red blood cells) and independent (levan) antigens have been compared.
      The unresponsive state which developed in GVH mice was expressed to comparable
      extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated recipients. Furthermore,
      GVH spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a mixed transfer system,
      but this effect was lost completely by day 21 whereas the original donors (or
      their cells) were still totally refractory after 80 days. This active suppressor
      effect was found to be mediated by T cells of perental origin based on cell
      fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or host cells by alloimmune
      attack. The delayed transfer of GVH cells to irradiated repopulated recipients
      challenged with antigen, indicated that suppressor T cells exert an anti-mitotic
      influence on antigen-stimulated B-cell proliferation. Supplementation of macrophage-depleted,
      anti-theta-treated GVH spleen cells with purified normal T cells demonstrated
      that B cells in GVH mice are normally reactive even when active suppression
      by T cells is no longer demonstrable. The likelihood that this later phase of
      immunosuppression is attributable to another mechanism is discussed.

TI  - Conditions for production, and some characteristics, of mycobacterial growth
      inhibitory factor produced by spleen cells from mice immunized with viable cells
      of the attenuated H37Ra strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PG  - 833-40
AB  - Mycobacterial growth inhibitory factor (MycoIF), found in supernatant fluids
      of mouse spleen cell cultures that have been stimulated in vitro with homologous
      antigen, inhibited the intracellular multiplication of virulent tubercle bacilli
      within normal mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Antigenically stimulated
      H37Ra-immunized mouse spleen cells required 72 h of incubation to produce supernatant
      fluids that would cause intracellular inhibition. Supernatant fluids from 48-h
      mouse spleen cell cultures were not able to produce intracellular inhibition.
      Investigation of the culture conditions showed that at lease 1.0% human serum
      was required in the tissue culture medium for the production of MycoIF by spleen
      cells from immunized mice. MycoIF activity was noted only in supernatant fluids
      from spleen cell cultures incubated with antigen for 72 h. MycoIF was nondialyzable
      and unaffected by freezing, lyophilization, or incubation at 60 C for 30 min.
      However, MycoIF was inactivated after incubation at 80 C for 30 min. MycoIF
      was unaffected by low hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 7 to 12), but exposure
      to higher hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 6, pH 5) significantly decrease MycoIF
      activity, and exposure to pH 4 to 2 abolished all activity. Supernatant fluids

TI  - A behavior modification training program for staff working with drug addicts.
PG  - 1073-101
AB  - This paper described a Behavior Modification Training Program, emphasizing self-control,
      for staff working with drug addicts. The program, which is primarily geared
      toward the training of paraprofessionals, takes place in ten 1-1/2 hour sessions
      and includes an overview of behavior modification as well as instruction in
      techniques of relaxation, desensitization, self-image improvement, behavior
      analysis, behavior control, assertive training, rational thinking, and how to
      set up and run similar behavior modification training programs for staff and
      patients. Since this training began at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute
      in November 1971, a total of 898 staff members, mostly paraprofessionals working
      with addicts, alcoholics, mentally ill patients, and inmates, including 53 from
      our own institution, 576 persons from other facilities in New Jersey, and 269
      from facilities in other states, have been trained, while 2,021 patients have
      been trained in similar programs. Most of this training has been accomplished
      by paraprofessionals. Preliminary evaluation data have been promising and the
      response of participants enthusiastic.

PG  - 189-95
AB  - The spontaneous activity exhibited in vitro by smooth muscle strips from the
      urinary bladder of the rabbit under the influence of Urecholine in concentrations
      from 0.3 to 30 muM has been characterized in terms of three parameters: mean
      tension, frequency of contraction, and contractile deviation, all obtained by
      computer an alysis. While mean tension and frequency monotonically increased
      with concentration, the contractile deviation rose to a peak in the vicinity
      of 3.0 to 6.0 muM and thereafter decreased. At concentrations less than 10 muM
      the contractile patterns were almost periodic, while at 10 and 30 muM, the patterns
      became highly erratic. Histologic examination of a limited number of tissues
      showed longitudinally oriented muscle bundles with multiple anastomosing.

TI  - Treatment of severe hypertension with minoxidil.
PG  - 991-8
AB  - Minoxidil in daily doses of 6 to 40 mg was administered to 11 patients with
      severe hypertension. Two patients died of causes unrelated to the drug and one
      patient withdrew from the study. Blood pressure was controlled in the remaining
      eight subjects, who received the drug for periods ranging from 5 to 40 months.
      In three patients minoxidil could subsequently be replaced by conventional antihypertensive
      therapy. Adverse effects of minoxidil included fluid retention (as assessed
      by edema and plasma volume studies), nonspecific ECG changes, hypertrichosis
      and conjunctival redness. Concomitant administration of diuretic and beta-adrenergic
      blocking agents resulted in excellent tolerance of the treatment and high patient
      compliance.

      ligand.
PG  - 131-7
AB  - A radioimmunoassay procedure for guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CGMP)
      is described. The procedure is based on competitive binding between [3H]CGMP
      and non-radioactive CGMP, with separation of bound and unbound CGMP by Millipore
      filtration. The binding reaction showed very high specificity to CGMP, had a
      broad pH optimum, and reached equilibrium within a short time. A simple procedure
      for the pruification of assay samples using Dowex AG 50W-X2 resin is also described.
      CGMP contents in urine samples were assayed without purification. Injection
      of glucagon into healthy human volunteers resulted in a small but significant
      reduction in urinary CGMP level, whereas CAMP excretion increased dramatically.

TI  - The effect of tryptophan administration on fatty acid synthesis in the livers
      of rats under various nutritional conditions.
PG  - 139-47
AB  - 1. Tryptophan was administered to rats under various nutritional conditions:
      fasted for 24 hr, fasted and refed with glucose or corn-oil, fasted and administered
      glycerol intramuscularly, and nonfasted. 2. The changes in the contents of glycolytic
      intermediates in the livers indicated that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
      [EC 4.1.1.32] reaction is inhibited by tryptophan administration in all groups
      of rats. The inversely related changes in the contents of malate and phosphoenolpyruvate
      were associated with the accumulation of quinolinate in the livers. The content
      of quinolinate which exhibited the half-maximal effect on the contents of both
      metabolites was 0.1-0.2 mumole per g liver. 3. The rate of incorporation of
      3H from 3H2O into the total hepatic fatty acids was increased about 2-fold by
      the administration of this amino acid to the fasted rats. The enhancement of
      the rate was closely related to the increase in the citrate content. The hyperlipogenesis
      was also related to the decrease of acetyl-CoA and the increase of malonyl-CoA.
      The content of long-chain acyl-CoA was not affected. These effects of tryptophan
      administration on the hepatic fatty acid metabolism were found in all groups
      of rats. The liver content of glycerol 3-phosphate was decreased by tryptophan
      administration was markedly increased by glycerol injection. The injection of
      glycerol into the control and the tryptophan-treated rats produced a marked
      increase of glycerol 3-phosphate but did not affect the rate of fatty acid synthesis
      in the livers of either group. 4. It may be concluded that, in the livers of
      rats under various nutritional conditions, the short-term control of fatty acid
      synthesis by tryptophan administration is most likely due to the activation
      of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase [EC 6.4.1.2] by citrate.

PG  - 198-203
AB  - A sialytransferase activity which catalyzes the synthesis of sialosylgalactosylceramide
      (G7) from added galactocerebroside and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid has been
      demonstrated in mouse brain microsomes. The enzyme reaction shows a pH optimum
      of 6.3 and requires detergents. Both Mn2+ and Ca2+ inhibited the reaction, whereas
      Mg2+ had no effect. The apparent Km for galactocerebroside leading to G7 was
      estimated to be 8.7 X 10(-4) M. The same microsomal preparation also synthesized
      hematoside when ceramide lactoside was the glycolipid acceptor. The apparent
      Km for ceramide lactoside was about one-tenth that for galactocerebroside. When
      the preparations were partially inactivated by heat the synthesis of G7 and
      of hematoside was reduced at approximately the same rate. Liver appeared to
      have the highest activity for G7 synthesis (as well as of hematoside), followed
      by brain. The synthesis of B7 by mouse brain microsomes in vitro demonstrates
      a new pathway for brain ganglioside synthesis.

PG  - 520-5
AB  - Since the coronary veins and capillaries are not involved with arteriosclerotic
      disease the authors performed experimental, and afterwards, clinical total and
      selective coronary vein arterialization. Acute myocardial ischaemia created
      for instance by ligation of the anterior descending branch, was treated by an
      internal mammary artery to regional coronary vein anastomosis. In 21 patients
      the selective arterialization of the "Vena cordis magna" or of "Vena cordis
      media", and total arterialization of the coronary sinus was performed. The clinical
      improvement and follow-up studies seem to be promising in the treatment of patients
      with advanced diffuse heavy coronary arteriosclerosis. In acute myocardial ischaemia
      with coronarographically localized coronary occlusion, the aim of regional vein
      arterialization is to minimize the area of infarction.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferation has been induced with 2-methyl-2-(p-[1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl]-phenoxy)-propionic
      acid (Su-13437). DNA, protein, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and
      acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant. Peroxisomal enzyme activities
      change to approximately 165%, 50%, 30%, and 0% of the controls for catalase,
      urate oxidase, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase, respectively.
      For catalase the change results from a decrease in particle-bound activity and
      a fivefold increase in soluble activity. The average diameter of peroxisome
      sections is 0.58 +/- 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 +/- 0.25 mum after treatment.
      Therefore, the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated
      particles. After tissue fractionation, approximately one-half of the normal
      peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost
      formation, but no change in size. In homogenates submitted to mechanical stress,
      proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility; unexpectedly, Su-13437
      stabilizes lysosomes. Our results suggest that matrix extraction and increased
      soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins.
      The changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and soluble catalase after
      Su-13437 allow the calculation of their half-lives. These are the same as those
      found for total catalase, in normal and treated rats, after allyl isopropyl
      acetamide: about 1.3 days, a result compatible with peroxisome degradation by
      autophagy. A sequential increase in liver RNA concentration, [14C]leucine incorporation
      into DOC-soluble proteins and into immunoprecipitable catalase, and an increase
      in liver size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver, characterize the trophic
      effect of the drug used. In males, Su-13437 is more active than CPIB, another
      peroxisome proliferation-inducing drug; in females, only Su-13437 is active.

TI  - Dependence on dose of the acute effects of ethanol on liver metabolism in vivo.
PG  - 1411-9
AB  - The dose dependence of the acute effects of ethanol upon liver intermediary
      metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in rats. Ethanol was given i.p. in
      doses of 0.69, 1.7, and 3.0 g/kg in equal volumes (20 ml/kg). The liver was
      freeze-clamped 120 min after injection, and multiple metabolites were measured
      in the perchloric acid extract of the tissue. Each group showed a significantly
      different pattern of metabolites, redox states, and phosphorylation potentials
      although the rate of ethanol disappearance, at least between the two highest
      dose groups, was not significantly different. The mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH]
      ratios and the cytoplasmic free [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio were paradoxically most
      reduced with the lowest dose of ethanol and became progressively more oxidized
      with increasing dose. Once established, the differences in these ratios between
      the groups tended to persist with time, relatively independent of the concentration
      of ethanol. In a somewhat different pattern, the phosphorylation potential ([ATP]/[ADP][P1])
      remained at the control level in the low-dose group but was significantly elevated
      in the two higher-dose groups. The results, therefore, show distinct and complicated
      dose-dependent patterns of intermediary metabolism that cannot be explained
      completely by any one hypothesis but that imply significant dose-dependent effects
      of ethanol upon intermediary metabolism not directly related to NADH production.

TI  - Evidence from rats that morphine tolerance is a learned response.
PG  - 498-506
AB  - It is proposed that the direct analgesic effect of morphine becomes attenuated
      over the course of successive administrations of the narcotic by a conditioned,
      compensatory, hyperalgesic response elicited by the administration procedure,
      the net result being analgesic tolerance. Using the "hot plate" analgesia assessment
      situation with rats, this conditioning view of tolerance is supported by several
      findings: (a) It is necessary to have reliable environmental cues predicting
      the systemic effects of morphine if tolerance is to be observed, (b) a hyperalgesic
      conditioned response may be observed in morphine-tolerant subjects when drug
      administration cues are followed by a placebo, and (c) merely by repeatedly
      presenting environmental cues previously associated with morphine (but now presented
      with a placebo), morphine tolerance can be extinguished.

TI  - Peroxisome development in the metanephric kidney of mouse.
PG  - 957-73
AB  - The relationship of enzymatic activity to organelle development and organelle
      number during differentiation of the metanephric kidney in the mouse was approached
      from several experimental directions. Biochemical analyses of marker enzymes
      for peroxisomes (catalase and D-amino acid oxidase), mitochondria (cytochrome
      oxidase) and lysosomes (acid phosphatase) were performed on kidneys at ages
      from 17 days prenatal to adult. These data were correlated with a morphometric
      analysis of populations of peroxisomes and mitochondria in differentiating cells
      of the proximal tubule. Postnatal development of the metanephric kidney was
      found to be accompanied by a rapid increase in both the specific activity of
      catalase and the number of peroxisomes per 100 mu2 in the proximal tubule during
      the first 4 weeks of postnatal growth. Elaboration of the endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER) was seen to parallel the increase in number of peroxisomes to which segments
      of ER were often in close apposition. Extensive interactions between segments
      of ER and peroxisomes were readily visible in 0.5-mu sections viewed in the
      high voltage electron microscope. In contrast to peroxisomes, neither mitochondria
      nor lysosomes followed a similar pattern of net organelle increase, suggesting
      that a defined population density of mitochondria and lysosomes may exist in
      the proximal tubule at birth, prior to complete development of the kidney.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of antihistamines and antiserotonins on the bone marrow reactions
      produced by Escherichia coli endotoxin in mice.
PG  - 611-16
AB  - The bone marrow reactions (that is, decrease of nucleated cell counts and increase
      of red blood cell counts) of mouse bone were observed 1 hr after injection of
      endotoxin and peaked after 18 hr. These reactions were significantly inhibited
      when diphenhydramine, promethazine (antihistamines), chlorpromazine (antiserotonin),
      or cyproheptadine (antihistamine and antiserotonin) was given 30 min before
      endotoxin. Such bone marrow reactions were also induced with histamine or serotonin
      and peaked 1 hr after administration. The histamine-induced changes were inhibited
      by prior treatment with diphenhydramine. These reactions were also produced
      by injection of a small amount of both histamine and serotonin, whereas no change
      was found when mice were given a single injection of a larger dose of histamine
      or serotonin. These results indicate that histamine and serotonin released in
      mice at the initial stage after endotoxin synergistically trigger the bone marrow
      reactions, which then continue in the presence of further mediators. Antihistamines
      and antiserotonins are considered to hinder the whole process of reactions produced
      by endotoxin.

AB  - A technique utilizing Pregnant Mare's Serum Gonadotropin and Human Chorionic
      Gonadotropin treatment of hens (Gallus domesticus), followed by manual ovulation
      of the excised follicles, was developed to obtain a large number of mature ova.
      The intact ova were used to test whether acrosin, partially purified from the
      spermatozoa of the cock (Gallus domesticus), partially purified rabbit testicular
      acrosin and commercial preparations of several hydrolytic enzymes could dissolve
      the inner vitelline membrane. Enzymes were applied to pieces of filter paper
      placed on the ovum. Cock acrosin and endopeptidases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin,
      collagenase and elastase hydrolyzed the membrane whereas exopeptidases such
      as leucine aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase A did not. Phospholipase A, sulfatase,
      hyaluronidase, beta-glucuronidase and rabbit testicular acrosin also failed
      to hydrolyze the membrane. Cock acrosin hydrolysis of the ovum surface was inhibited
      by soybean trypsin inhibitor. The surface of the ovum over the germinal disc
      region was hydrolyzed more quickly by cock acrosin than the surface over other
      regions of the ovum. Acrosin from cock sperm caused the release of trichloroacetic
      acid soluble material absorbing at 280 nm from sonicated preparations of inner
      vitelline membranes. Hydrolysis was greatest at pH 8.0 and was inhibited by
      soybean trypsin inhibitor.

AB  - A modified version of systematic desensitization was used to reduce the anxiety
      and negative interpersonal consequences produced by a recurrent aversive dream
      resulting from events in the real world. The subject, a 16-year-old incarcerated
      male, was first taught a standard relaxation technique. The subject's dream
      was divided into 12 hierarchical imaginal scenes. Following initial relaxation,
      each scene was sequentially introduced and followed by the therapist's suggestion
      that the subject was still very relaxed. After three sessions with the therapists
      and several practice sessions by himself, the subject reported no further anxiety
      to the dream (which continued to occur) and improved relations with the institutional
      staff. Six months of follow-up showed no recurrence of the anxiety or the subsequent
      irritability which the subject had initially reported as leading to negative
      interpersonal relations with the staff.

PG  - 45-9
AB  - Arteriograms of the basilar artery reveal that dopamine given intracisternally
      to dogs can generate cerebral vasospasm. This finding supports a recent hypothesis
      of others that dopamine may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm, especially
      since many substances are known which fail to produce such spasm. Compared to
      blood or prostaglandin E2, however, the spasm induced by dopamine was delayed
      in onset, less in incidence, and usually less intense. Possible explanations
      for such experimental differences are discussed.

PG  - 1422-32
AB  - This study was designed to measure the response of key enzymes of ketone body
      metabolism in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver to diet and exercise, two conditions
      known to influence ketone body utilization. A 3 (diet: control, high fat, or
      high carbohydrate) X 2 (kill condition: rested or exhausted) X 2 (training:
      trained or untrained) factorial design was used to estimate main experimental
      effects as well as identify significant interactions of the variables. Physical
      training (treadmill running) was associated with a doubling of the activity
      of skeletal muscle 3-oxoacid CoA transferase, a key enzyme in extrahepatic ketone
      body utilization. The activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of liver ketone body
      production, hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthetase (HMG CoA synthetase), was not
      greatly influenced by training or exhuastive exercise indicating that the metabolic
      control of the ketosis of exercise may more likely be a function of the supply
      of fatty acids to the liver rather than the activity of HMG CoA synthetase.
      Feeding a high fat diet, on the other hand, significantly increased the activity
      of liver HMG CoA synthetase, indicating that the ketosis of fat feeding may
      be of a different nature than that of exercise. The results of this study indicate
      that physical training is associated with biochemical adaptations in ketone
      body metabolism as well as fatty acid oxidation, and that trained individuals
      are metabolically better endowed to benefit from the ketosis of exercise than
      untrained individuals.

TI  - Some mechanisms of reduction of carotenoid levels in chickens infected with
      Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella.
PG  - 1447-56
AB  - The levels of plasma carotenoids were markedly reduced in broiler cockerels
      infected with Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella. The mechanisms of this depigmentation
      differed between the two species, being primarily associated with interference
      of absorption of xanthophyll (carotenoids) from the intestinal lumen with E.
      acervulina infection and with leakage through the damaged wall of the cecum
      with E. tenella infection. Chicks reared on an essentially carotenoid-free diet
      and inoculated with E. acervulina showed no detectable levels of carotenoids
      in the blood 48 hours after being changed to a diet containing 30 mg of xanthophyll/kg.
      Conversely, uninoculated chicks and chicks inoculated with E. tenella showed
      significant and similar increases in plasma levels of carotenoids. Chicks reared
      on a diet containing xanthophyll and inoculated with E. tenella showed a more
      rapid decrease in plasma carotenoids than did uninoculated controls when changed
      to a xanthophyll-free diet. In chicks fed high xanthophyll diets containing
      chromic oxide, no indication of malabsorption was seen in chicks infected with
      E. tenella compared with uninoculated controls, whereas chicks inoculated with
      E. acervulina showed significantly less xanthophyll absorption. Conversely,
      a marked increase in the xanthophyll : Cr2O3 ratio was observed in the cecal
      contents of chicks inoculated with E. tenella compared with uninuoculated controls
      or those inoculated with E. acervulina. Studies of uninoculated chicks pair-fed
      with chicks inoculated with E. acervulina or E. tenella indicated that the decrease
      in plasma carotenoids and increases in intestinal pH are not associated with
      the reduced intake of feed associated with infection. The studies involving
      uninoculated birds with reciprocal chagnes between high and low xanthophyll
      diets indicated that plasma carotenoids are a more rapid and sensitive means
      of measuring changes in pigmentation levels than are visual skin scores carotenoid
      levels from the skin.
