AB  - Ovarian torsion can be defined as the bending of the ovaries on the supporting 
      ligament, disrupting both venous and arterial blood circulation. Insufficient 
      blood flow causes ovarian tissue hypoxia and leads to ischemia. This study aimed 
      to investigate whether tocilizumab has a protective effect on 
      ischemia-reperfusion injury due to ovarian torsion in rats. Eighteen female 
      Wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups (Sham (SG), 
      ischemia-reperfusion (OIR), and ischemia-reperfusion+tocilizumab (OIRT)). 
      Degeneration, necrosis, vascular dilatation/congestion, interstitial edema, 
      hemorrhage, and polymorphonuclear lymphocyte (PMNL) infiltration scores were 
      significantly different between the groups (p=0.001 for all parameters). 
      Moreover, the OIRT group had a significant improvement in these criteria compared 
      to the OIR group (p<0.05). Additionally, there was a considerable difference 
      between OIRT and OIR groups in the number of primordial, developing, and atretic 
      follicles groups (p<0.05), while there was no difference in the number of corpus 
      luteum (p=0.052). Stress markers or cytokines, such as MDA, tGSH, NF-κB, TNF-α, 
      IL-1β, and IL-6, were significantly different between groups (p<0.05). 
      Furthermore, a significant improvement was found in the measured variables when 
      the OIRT group was compared with the OIR group (p<0.05). Tocilizumab may be an 
      alternative option for treating ischemia-reperfusion injury due to ovarian 
      torsion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of ultra-processed food consumption and 
      associated factors among children enrolled in the public school system of the 
      city of Barbacena, Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study 
      conducted with schoolchildren aged 7-9 years, of both sexes, enrolled in state 
      public schools. Food intake was assessed using the Previous Day Food 
      Questionnaire and the level of physical activity by the Previous Day Physical 
      Activity Questionnaire. The listed foods were classified according to the extent 
      and purpose of industrial processing, using the NOVA classification. Pearson's χ2 
      test, Fisher's exact test, χ2 with Yates correction, and Poisson regression were 
      used in the statistical analysis, estimating the crude and adjusted prevalence 
      ratio, with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The prevalence of daily 
      ultra-processed food consumption was 69.6%. After adjusted analyses, the 
      consumption of ultra-processed food was associated with the omission of 
      breakfast, mid-afternoon snack, supper, low physical activity, and consumption of 
      risk foods. On the other hand, consumption of in natura or minimally processed 
      foods was associated with older age, the consumption of lunch, mid-afternoon 
      snack, dinner, and protective foods. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of 
      ultra-processed foods consumption, associated with unhealthy dietary habits among 
      schoolchildren. This highlights the need for nutritional counseling and 
      educational actions, favoring healthy eating in childhood.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the effect of telecounseling in reducing 
      the anxiety and depression experienced by pregnant women. METHOD: This randomized 
      control trial was conducted on 100 pregnant women (50 in each intervention and 
      control group). The intervention group received telecounseling with regard to the 
      mother and the fetus as needed between 08:00 h and 20:00 h for 6 weeks at home. 
      The control group received only routine care. Anxiety and depression levels were 
      evaluated at the beginning and end of the study using the Hospital Anxiety 
      Depression Scale. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression levels were found to be lower 
      in the intervention group than in the control group (p<0.001). In the control 
      group, the anxiety score increased from 5.62 to 7.16, and the depression score 
      increased from 4.92 to 5.76 without any intervention (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This 
      study shows that telecounseling may have an effect on reducing the level of 
      anxiety and depression of pregnant women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of intrapartum 
      cardiotocography in identifying fetal acidemia by umbilical cord blood analysis 
      in low-risk pregnancies. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 
      low-risk singleton pregnancies in labor after performing intrapartum 
      cardiotocography categories I, II, and III. The presence of fetal acidemia at 
      birth was identified by analyzing the pH of umbilical cord arterial blood 
      (pH<7.1). RESULTS: No significant effect of the cardiotocography category on the 
      arterial (p=0.543) and venous (p=0.770) pH of umbilical cord blood was observed. 
      No significant association was observed between the cardiotocography category and 
      the presence of fetal acidemia (p=0.706), 1-min Apgar score <7 (p=0.260), 
      hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (p=0.605), newborn death 
      within the first 48 h, need for neonatal resuscitation (p=0.637), and adverse 
      perinatal outcomes (p=0.373). Sensitivities of 62, 31, and 6.0%; positive 
      predictive values of 11.0, 16.0, and 10.0%; and negative predictive values of 85, 
      89.0, and 87.0% were observed for cardiotocography categories I, II, and III, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The three categories of intrapartum cardiotocography 
      presented low sensitivities and high negative predictive values to identify fetal 
      acidemia at birth in low-risk pregnancies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate CD56 immunostaining in the 
      stroma of benign and malignant ovarian epithelial neoplasms and associate the 
      CD56 immunostaining with prognostic factors and survival in ovarian cancer. 
      METHODS: Patients with ovarian epithelial neoplasia (n=77) were studied with a 
      prospective cohort. The CD56 immunostaining was evaluated in the peritumoral 
      stroma. Two groups were evaluated: benign ovarian neoplasms (n=40) and malignant 
      ovarian neoplasms (n=37). Data were recorded for histological type and grade, 
      International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging, molecular subtype, 
      and lymph node metastases. Fisher's exact test and Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
      were used, with a significance level of ≤0.05. RESULTS: We found greater CD56 
      stromal immunostaining in malignant neoplasms when compared to the group of 
      benign neoplasms (p=0.00001). There was no significant difference in relation to 
      the prognostic factors and survival. CONCLUSION: Malignant ovarian neoplasms 
      showed higher stromal CD56 immunostaining. As the prognostic value of natural 
      killer in ovarian cancer is controversial, knowing the specific function of each 
      cell present both in the tumor tissue and systemically may help guide successful 
      immunotherapies in the near future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A few pediatric studies were present which focused on renal 
      replacement therapy used for critically ill children. This research aimed to 
      determine the ratio of utilization of intermittent hemodialysis, continuous renal 
      replacement therapy, and peritoneal dialysis, and to study the properties and 
      outcomes of critically ill pediatric patients who underwent renal replacement 
      therapy. METHODS: Critically ill children admitted to the intensive care unit and 
      received renal replacement therapy from February 2020 to May 2022 were included. 
      The children were divided into three groups: hemodialysis, continuous renal 
      replacement therapy, and peritoneal dialysis. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients (22 
      boys and 15 girls) who received renal replacement therapy met the criteria for 
      this study. Continuous renal replacement therapy was used in 43%, hemodialysis in 
      38%, and peritoneal dialysis in 19%. In all, 28 (73%) children survived and 9 
      (27%) died in intensive care unit. The mean systolic blood pressure was 
      significantly lower among children who received continuous renal replacement 
      therapy (p<0.001). The need for inotropic medications and a higher PRISM III 
      score were found to be the greatest indicators of mortality. CONCLUSION: The 
      outcome of children receiving renal replacement therapy seems to be related to 
      their needs for vasoactive drugs and the severity of the underlying disease in 
      the continuous renal replacement therapy group relative to the other groups.

AB  - The scope of this study was to understand the effects resulting from Integrative 
      and Complementary Practices (ICPs) in the treatment of people with obesity cared 
      for at a state center of reference of the Brazilian Unified Health System, based 
      on the reports of users. Qualitative exploratory-descriptive methodology was 
      used, employing semi-structured interviews as a technique for data production. 
      The empirical universe was composed of eight male and female members in the adult 
      age group, with a medical diagnosis of obesity and being monitored at the ICP 
      Outpatient Clinic. Feeling well was observed as a significant and pivotal 
      sensation for the ongoing experience in the ICPs, resulting from the therapy, 
      materialized in the different effects produced by the practices and bringing 
      about a reorganization of the subject's life, the care of oneself and of others. 
      It was possible to observe that the organic presence of the ICPs assumes a hybrid 
      and dynamic place in the process of care, although a perspective has emerged that 
      links the ICPs to obesity through the control of anxiety, the body, and food. 
      Furthermore, the ICPs seem to collaborate with the displacement of the focus of 
      body weight management to the person as a whole, also acting as mediators in the 
      process of body acceptance.

AB  - Suicide among women is a matter of public health, and there is a lack of 
      scientific literature on this issue. In this theoretical essay, we sought to 
      discuss suicide among women in Brazil from a gender perspective. For that 
      purpose, we adopted the idea that gender extrapolates the concept of sex, 
      considering that differences between people are produced by culture and 
      arrangements through which society transforms biological sexuality into the 
      realizations of human life. Therefore, this article is organized in a way to 
      indicate some explanatory models of suicide among women, discussing gender 
      inequalities and approaching the matter of intersectionality from a protective 
      view. Moreover, we believe that the theme is extremely complex, considering that 
      stigma still resists, as does prejudice related to this issue. Hence, it is of 
      utmost importance to view the structural questions that refer to suicide in 
      women, such as violence and gender inequalities.

AB  - This study analyzes supply characteristics and factors associated with the 
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Brazil, with a focus on disease 
      course-modifying biological drugs (bioDMARDs). A retrospective study was 
      conducted with secondary data from the Outpatient Information System of the 
      Unified Health System. Patients aged 16 years or older who were treated in 2019 
      were eligible. The analyses were performed with exposure factors in relation to 
      the outcomes: bioDMARD use and population size. The study included 155,679 
      patients, 84.6% of whom were women. There was a greater exchange of bioDMARDs and 
      a greater supply of rheumatologists in the larger municipalities (more than 
      500,000 inhabitants). Almost 40% of the patients used bioDMARDs, and they showed 
      greater adherence to treatment (57.0% versus 64%, p=0.001). The dispensing of 
      bioDMARDs occurred in more than one-third of the patients treated for rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA) in Brazil and was associated with a higher percentage of 
      availability of rheumatologists and larger population size.

AB  - In 2015, a range of congenital anomalies resulting from mother-to-child 
      transmission of the zika virus emerged. Later called congenital zika syndrome 
      (CZS), the condition includes microcephaly. Since then, around 4,000 children 
      have been affected in 27 countries, with Brazil accounting for the largest 
      proportion of cases. Family caregivers have also been affected. This study 
      analyzes the literature on caregivers of children with CZS and how the disease 
      has affected their everyday lives. We conducted an integrative review using the 
      PubMed, Virtual Health Library, and Embase databases. Thirty-one articles were 
      identified for analysis after screening. The findings were grouped into four 
      categories: a) social impacts - changes in family relationships, life projects, 
      and social life; b) subjective impacts - feelings of resilience, loneliness, 
      grief, overburdening, fear, uncertainty, and spirituality and religion; c) 
      economic and material impacts - loss of income, increased household expenses, 
      change of residence, and unemployment; and d) health impacts - service 
      unpreparedness, selflessness, self-care, changes in nutritional and sleep

AB  - We evaluated data from 14,156 baseline participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal 
      Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) collected from 2008 to 2010, to analyze the 
      effect modification of occupational social class on the association between sex 
      and prevalence of type 2 diabetes. The crude and age-adjusted prevalence, 
      according to sex and occupational social class, were estimated using generalized 
      linear models with binomial distribution and logarithmic link function. This 
      model was also used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR), adjusting for age group, 
      race/skin color, and maternal education. The effect modification was measured in 
      the multiplicative and additive scales. Males had higher crude and age-adjusted 
      prevalence in all occupational social class strata. As occupational social class 
      increases, the prevalence among males and females decreases. The PR of males to 
      females decreased according to occupational class: 66% (PR = 1.66; 95%CI: 1.44; 
      1.90), 39% (PR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.02; 1.89), and 28% (PR = 1.28; 95%CI: 0.94; 1.75) 
      in the high, middle, and low occupational social classes, respectively. We found 
      an inverse effect of the occupational social class on the association between sex 
      and type 2 diabetes on the multiplicative scale, suggesting that it acts as an 
      effect modifier.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the Global 
      Assessment of Pediatric Patient Safety (GAPPS) in order to identify patient 
      safety incidents with patient harm or adverse events (AEs). METHODS: This is a 
      cross-sectional, retrospective study of 240 records of hospitalized patients of 
      both genders under 18 years of age, systematically and randomly selecting 10 
      charts of patients that meet the GAPPS criteria every 15 days from the 4,041 
      records of 2017. RESULTS: The prevalence of AEs was 12.5%, i.e., detected in 30 
      out of 240 medical records. In total, 53 AEs and 63 harm were recorded, of which 
      53 (84.1%) were temporary and 43 AE (68.2%) were definitely or probably 
      preventable. The presence of at least one trigger in a medical chart revealed 13 
      times greater chance of the occurrence of an AE, with sensitivity index of 48.5%, 
      specificity of 100%, and accuracy of 86.5%. CONCLUSION: GAPPS was effective in 
      detecting patient safety incidents with harm or AE.

AB  - Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is associated with thoracic compression of 
      the lungs and heart caused by the herniated abdominal content, leading to cardiac 
      modifications including pressure and vascular changes. Our aim was to investigate 
      the experimental immunoexpression of the capillary proliferation, activation, and 
      density of Ki-67, VEGFR2, and lectin in the myocardium after surgical creation of 
      a diaphragmatic defect. Pregnant New Zealand rabbits were operated on the 25th 
      gestational day in order to create left-sided CDH (LCDH, n=9), right-sided CDH 
      (RCDH, n=9), and Control (n=9), for a total of 27 fetuses in 19 pregnant rabbits. 
      Five days after the procedure, animals were sacrificed, and histology and 
      immunohistochemistry studies of the harvested hearts were performed. Total body 
      weight and heart weight were not significantly different among groups (P=0.702 
      and 0.165, respectively). VEGFR2 expression was increased in both ventricles in 
      the RCDH group (P<0.0001), and Ki-67 immunoexpression was increased in the left 
      ventricle in the LCDH group compared to Control and RCDH groups (P<0.0001). In 
      contrast, capillary density was reduced in the left ventricle in the LCDH 
      compared to the Control and RCDH groups (P=0.002). Left and right ventricles 
      responded differently to CDH in this model depending on the laterality of the 
      diaphragmatic defect. This surgical model of diaphragmatic hernia was associated 
      with different expression patterns of capillary proliferation, activation, and 
      density in the myocardium of the ventricles of newborn rabbits.

AB  - The cardioprotective effect of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) 
      has been demonstrated in several studies. Similarly, physical exercise has 
      yielded positive results. However, the effects of their combination remain 
      inconclusive. This review describes the combined effects of physical exercise and 
      hormone therapy on cardiovascular and metabolic health in postmenopausal women. 
      We searched the Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases and included 
      randomized controlled trials published up to December 2021 on the combined 
      effects of physical exercise and hormone therapy on cardiovascular and metabolic 
      health in postmenopausal women. We identified 148 articles, of which only seven 
      met the inclusion criteria (386 participants; 91 [23%] HRT + exercise; 104 [27%] 
      HRT; 103 [27%] exercise; 88 [23%] placebo). The combined treatment further 
      decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to the isolated effect of 
      aerobic training (AT) (mean difference [MD]=-1.69; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]=-2.65 to -0.72, n=73). Nevertheless, it attenuated the decrease in diastolic 
      blood pressure (DBP) (MD=0.78; 95%CI: 0.22-1.35, n=73), and the increase in peak 
      oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) promoted by exercise (AT + HRT=2.8±1.4 vs AT + 
      placebo=5.8±3.4, P=0.02). The combination of AT and oral HRT improved SBP. 
      However, AT alone seemed to have a better effect on physical fitness and DBP in 
      postmenopausal women.

AB  - Rhodnius neglectus is a wild triatomine, vector of the protozoan Trypanosoma 
      cruzi, which causes Chagas' disease, and feeds on the blood of small mammals, 
      being essential for its growth and reproduction. Accessory glands of the female 
      reproductive tract are important in insect reproduction, but their anatomy and 
      histology in R. neglectus are poorly studied. The aim of this work was to 
      describe the histology and histochemistry of the accessory gland of the female 
      reproductive tract of R. neglectus. The reproductive tract of five females of R. 
      neglectus was dissected and the accessory glands transferred to Zamboni's 
      fixative solution, dehydrated in a crescent series of ethanol, embedded in 
      historesin, sectioned at 2 µm thick, stained with toluidine blue for histological 
      analysis or mercury bromophenol blue for detection of total proteins. The 
      accessory gland R. neglectus is tubular, without branches, opening in the dorsal 
      region of the vagina and differing along its length in proximal and distal 
      regions. In the proximal region, the gland is lined by the cuticle with a layer 
      of columnar cells associated with muscle fibers. In the distal region of the 
      gland, the epithelium has spherical secretory cells with terminal apparatus and 
      conducting canaliculi opening in the lumen through pores in the cuticle. Proteins 
      were identified in the gland lumen, terminal apparatus, nucleus and cytoplasm of 
      secretory cells. The histology of the R. neglectus gland is similar to that found 
      in other species of this genus, but with variations in the shape and size of its 
      distal region.

AB  - to analyze the profile of nurses regarding integrative and complementary 
      practices in health (ICPH) and understand how they are used in the care of people 
      with arterial hypertension. mixed-methods sequential explanatory design. The 
      cross-sectional quantitative stage included 386 nurses who completed an online 
      questionnaire addressing sociodemographic and professional information, training, 
      and practice, with a descriptive and inferential analysis. The qualitative stage 
      was performed via 18 online interviews with professionals who had ICPH training 
      and implemented it in the care provided to individuals with hypertension, with a 
      participatory analysis. Integration occurred through a connecting approach. 
      36.8% had ICPH training; most were women, Caucasian, married, public servants, 
      aged 37 (+ 9.4) on average; 14.2% incorporated ICPH into the care provided to 
      people with hypertension; predominantly auriculotherapy (28.2%) and bloodletting 
      in hypertensive crises. The results show that nurses integrally approached 
      patients, and their approach was not limited to the vital sign altered at the 
      time, but they also intervened in anxiety, stress, sleep, and rest. A 
      potentiality observed concerns support treatment adherence. the profile of nurses 
      with ICPH training is presented, and such practice has implications for lowering 
      blood pressure. ICPH has been incorporated into the care of people with 
      hypertension, but its use is still incipient, considering its potential in 
      nursing care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to analyze obstetric nurses' professional training in Minas Gerais 
      between 1957 and 1999, according to genealogical principles. METHODS: a 
      qualitative interpretative study based on historical research with genealogical 
      analysis. Data were obtained through documentary research and oral history, with 
      six participants, and submitted to discourse analysis. RESULTS: they recompose 
      the genealogical path of obstetric nurses' professional training from Minas. The 
      speeches reveal field of practice deprivation in professional training and the 
      importance of the articulation between the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais 
      Nursing School and Hospital Sofia Feldman for teaching and work in obstetric 
      nursing. It was identified that training, in the national scenario, evolved from 
      a Escola de Enfermagem Carlos Chagas' peripheral initiative to centrality and 
      capillarity. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: the unique historical trajectory of obstetric 
      nurses' professional training in Minas Gerais, marked by ruptures, institutional 
      articulations, conflicting games and interest, was unveiled.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To verify whether parental physical activity and social support are 
      associated with adolescents meeting physical activity recommendations. METHODS: 
      This is a cross-sectional study that selected 1,390 adolescents (59.6% girls) 
      from Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil. The IPAQ (International Physical Activity 
      Questionnaire), QAFA (Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents), and ASAFA 
      (Social Support for Physical Activity Practice in Adolescents) questionnaires 
      were applied. Binary logistic regression was used to test the relationship among 
      the study variables. RESULTS: For boys, having parents who "always attend" (OR = 
      1.96; 95%CI: 1.16-3.32) and having parents or legal guardians who meet the PA 
      recommendations (OR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.76-4.38) were associated with meeting the PA 
      recommendations. Odds were greater after adjusting for socioeconomic status (OR = 
      3.47; 95%CI: 1.73-6.96) and schooling level (OR = 4.20; 95%CI: 1.96-9.02). For 
      girls, those with parents or legal guardians who "sometimes encourage them" (OR = 
      0.61; 95%CI: 0.37-0.98) had lower odds of meeting PA recommendations. These odds 
      were higher after adjusting for socioeconomic status (OR = 2.11; 95%CI: 
      1.36-3.29) and schooling level (OR = 4.30; 95%CI: 2.41-7.69). CONCLUSIONS: Boys 
      and girls were more likely to meet PA recommendations daily by having parents who 
      meet PA recommendations than by receiving parental social support. These results 
      could help establish future interventions aimed at modifying behaviors related to 
      PA in adolescents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations among race/color, gender, and intrinsic 
      capacity (IC) (total and by domains) in middle-aged and older adults from a 
      Brazilian cohort. As a secondary objective, we investigate these associations 
      across Brazilian regions. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 
      baseline data from the 2015-2016 Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging 
      (ELSI-Brazil). IC was investigated via cognitive (verbal fluency), physical (gait 
      velocity/handgrip), and psychosocial (Center for Epidemiological Studies 
      Depression) domains. Moreover, IC sensory domain was evaluated via self-reported 
      sensory disease diagnoses (vision and/or hearing impairment) and race/color was 
      identified via self-reported criteria. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 9,070 
      participants (aged ≥ 50 years). Black and Brown participants were 80% and 41% 
      more likely to show a worse IC cognitive domain than white controls, respectively 
      (OR = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.42-2.28, p < 0.001 and OR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.21-1.65, p < 
      0.001). Moreover, Black and Brown women had almost a threefold greater chance of 
      showing a worse IC than white men (OR = 2.91, 95%CI: 1.89-4.47, p < 0.001 and OR 
      = 2.51, 95%CI: 2.09 - 3.02, p < 0.001) and a 62% (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.02-2.57) 
      and 32% (OR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.10-1.57) greater risk of falling below our IC score 
      cutoff point than white women. We found the greatest differences in the Brazilian 
      South, whereas its North showed the lowest associations among race/color, gender, 
      and IC. CONCLUSION: IC racial and gender disparities reinforce the need for 
      public health policies to guarantee equality during aging. Promoting greater 
      access to good health care requires understanding how racism and sexism can 
      contribute to health inequities and their consequences in different Brazilian 
      regions.

      In addition, the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Bristol 
      Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Scored Form questionnaires were evaluated for 
      each subject. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was calculated as 23.78±3.04 
      years, which was similar for both groups (p=0.340). Body mass index, waist 
      circumference, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Bristol Female 
      Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Scored Form, and modified Ferriman-Gallwey scores 
      were significantly higher in group 2 (p<<0.001). Hyperandrogenism, lipid profile, 
      and glucose metabolism disorders were more frequent in group 2 (p<<0.05). Bladder 
      capacity (Q max), bladder wall thickness, and post-void residual volume values 
      were similar in both groups (p>>0.05). CONCLUSION: In our study, a close 
      relationship was observed between polycystic ovary syndrome and lower urinary 
      tract symptoms. In this context, we think that a detailed urinary system 
      evaluation of women with polycystic ovary syndrome is extremely important.

AB  - We aimed to determine the herd and animal levels seroprevalence and associated 
      factors for Toxoplasma gondii infections in cattle from the state of Paraíba, 
      Northeastern Brazil. Herds (n = 434) and cows aged ≥ 24 months (n = 1,895) were 
      randomly selected, and serum samples were tested with the immunofluorescence 
      antibody test (IFAT) using as cutoff of 64. Of the 434 farms investigated, 197 
      had at least one seropositive cow (prevalence of 49.0%; 95% CI = 44.3%-53.8%), 
      and the prevalence at animal level was 18.0% (95% CI = 5.3%-21.1%). The antibody 
      titers ranged from 64 to 1024, with the most frequent titers being 64 (10.8%) and 
      128 (3.7%). The risk factors identified were property located in Sertão region 
      (odds ratio [OR] = 3.07), property located in Agreste/Zona da Mata regions (OR = 
      2.00), animal purchasing (OR = 2.68), herd size of 34-111 animals (OR = 2.91) and 
      herd size > 111 animals (OR = 6.97). The results suggest the wide distribution of 
      T. gondii infections in cattle throughout the state of Paraíba, and the risk 
      factors identified are not possible to correct.

AB  - There are no records of autochthonous cases of canine visceral leishmaniasis in 
      the city of Curitiba, Paraná state, Brazil. In 2020, a male French bulldog 
      (CW01), approximately 2 years old was taken by its owners to a private 
      veterinarian clinic. The suspicion of CVL was confirmed by means of a serology 
      test (ELISA/IFAT reagent), rapid chromatographic immunoassay (DPP®) (ELISA - 
      Biomanguinhos®), parasitological culture and quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction (qPCR). The animal routinely frequented parks in Curitiba and was taken 
      on several trips to the municipalities of Bombinhas and Balneário Camboriú (Santa 
      Catarina) and to Matinhos (Paraná) where CVL had not previously been reported. 
      Treatment was initiated orally with Milteforan™ which resulted in a significant 
      reduction in the parasitic load. The suspicion of autochthony was investigated 
      through entomological research. A total of 10 traps were installed, one at the 
      animal's home, seven in adjacent city blocks and two in a forest edge. No 
      sandflies were trapped in the dog's home and adjacent houses. The traps in the 
      forest edge caught one Migonemyia migonei female and five Brumptomyia spp. 
      females. This case serves as a warning of the possible introduction of CVL in the 
      city of Curitiba.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of hepatic lymphoma has been increasing recently and 
      diagnosis can be challenging as clinical presentation and radiological findings 
      are usually variable and non-specific. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to 
      describe their main clinical, pathological and imaging characteristics and 
      identify poor prognostic factors. METHODS: A retrospective study that included 
      all patients with histological diagnosis of liver lymphoma over a 10-year period 
      at our center was performed. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were identified, 
      with mean age of 56.6 years and male predominance (58%). There were three 
      patients with primary liver lymphoma (8.3%) and 33 with secondary liver lymphoma 
      (91.7%). The most common histological type was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
      (33.3%). The most common clinical manifestations included fever, lymphadenopathy, 
      weight loss, night sweats and abdominal discomfort; three patients (11.1%) were 
      asymptomatic. Computed tomography scan revealed heterogenous radiological 
      patterns including a single nodule (26.5%), multiple nodules (41.2%) or diffuse 
      infiltration (32.4%). The mortality rate during follow-up was 55.6%. Higher 
      levels of C-reactive protein (P=0.031) and absence of treatment response 
      (P<0.001) were significantly associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: 
      Hepatic lymphoma is a rare disease that may involve liver as part of a systemic 
      disease or, less commonly, be confined to this organ. Clinical presentation and 
      radiological findings are often variable and non-specific. It is associated with 
      high mortality and poor prognostic factors include higher levels of C-reactive 
      protein and absence of response to treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there is conflicting evidence linking Helicobacter pylori 
      (HP) infection with weight loss and endoscopic findings after Roux-en-Y gastric 
      bypass (RYGB). OBJECTIVE: To identify correlations between HP infection and its 
      eradication with weight loss and endoscopic findings after RYGB. METHODS: This is 
      an observational retrospective cohort study based on a prospectively collected 
      database of individuals who underwent RYGB from 2018-2019 at a tertiary 
      university hospital. HP infection and the HP eradication therapy outcomes were 
      correlated with post-operative weight loss and endoscopic findings. Individuals 
      were classified according to the status of HP infection into four groups: no 
      infection; successful eradication; refractory infection; and new-onset infection. 
      RESULTS: Of 65 individuals, 87% were female and the mean age was 39±11.2 years. 
      Body mass index significantly decreased from 36.2±3.6 to 26.7±3.3 kg/m2 one year 
      after RYGB (P<0.0001). The percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was 25.9±7.2% 
      and the percentage of excess weight loss was 89.4±31.7%. HP infection prevalence 
      decreased from 55.4% to 27.7% (p=0.001); 33.8% never had HP infection, 38.5% were 
      successfully treated, 16.9% had refractory infection and 10.8 % had new-onset HP 
      infection. %TWL was 27.3±7.5% in individuals who never had HP, 25.4±8.1% in the 
      successfully treated, 25.7±5.2% in those with refractory infection, and 23.4±6.4% 
      in the new-onset HP infection group; there were no significant differences among 
      the four groups (P=0.6). Pre-operative HP infection significantly associated with 
      gastritis (P=0.048). New-onset HP infections significantly associated with a 
      lower frequency of jejunal erosions after surgery (P=0.048). CONCLUSION: No 
      effects of the HP infection on weight loss were identified in individuals 
      undergoing RYGB. A higher prevalence of gastritis was observed in individuals 
      with HP infection before RYGB. New-onset HP infection after RYGB was a protective 
      factor for jejunal erosions.

TI  - THE EVALUATION OF INFLIXIMAB TROUGH LEVEL FAVORS MAINTENANCE THERAPY OF PATIENTS 
      WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic diseases 
      that result from the deregulation of the mucosal immune system of the 
      gastrointestinal tract. The use of biological therapies, including infliximab 
      (IFX), is one of the strategies to treat both CD and UC. The IFX treatment is 
      monitored by complementary tests, namely: fecal calprotectin (FC); C-reactive 
      protein (CRP); and endoscopic and cross-sectional imaging. Besides, serum IFX 
      evaluation and antibody detection are also used. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trough 
      levels (TL) and antibodies in a population with inflammatory bowel (IBD) disease 
      undergoing treatment with IFX, and the factors that might impact the treatment 
      effectiveness. METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional study with patients with 
      IBD that were assessed for TL and antibody (ATI) levels in a southern Brazilian 
      hospital, from June 2014 to July 2016. RESULTS: The study assessed 55 patients 
      (52.7% female) submitted to serum IFX and antibody evaluations (95 blood samples, 
      55 first test; 30 second test, and 10 as third testing. Forty-five (47.3%) cases 
      were diagnosed with CD (81.8%), and ten with UC (18.2%). Serum levels were 
      adequate in 30 samples (31.57%), subtherapeutic in 41 (43.15%), and 
      supratherapeutic in 24 (25.26%). IFX dosages were optimized for 40 patients 
      (42.10%), maintained for 31 (32.63%), and discontinued for 7 (7.60%). The 
      intervals between infusions were shortened in 17.85% of the cases. In 55 tests 
      (55.79%), the therapeutic approach was exclusively defined according to IFX 
      and/or serum antibody levels. The assessment of patients one year later indicated 
      that: the approach was maintained with IFX for thirty-eight patients (69.09%); 
      the class of biological agent was changed for eight (14.54%); changes using the 
      same class of biological agent occurred for two patients (3.63%); the medication 
      was discontinued and not replaced for three patients (5.45%), and four patients 
      (7.27%) were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: There were no differences in TL 
      between groups with or without immunosuppressants, serum albumin (ALB), 
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), FC, CRP, and endoscopic and imaging 
      examinations. Current therapeutic approach could be maintained for almost 70% of 
      patients. Thus, serum and antibody levels are a useful tool in the follow-up of 
      patients undergoing maintenance therapy and after treatment induction in patients 
      with inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer mortality is greater in countries with a high Human 
      Development Index (HDI). This study analyzed pancreatic cancer mortality rates 
      trends, and their correlation with HDI in Brazil over 40 years. METHODS: Data on 
      pancreatic cancer mortality in Brazil between 1979 and 2019 were obtained from 
      the Mortality Information System (SIM). Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) 
      and Annual Average Percent Change (AAPC) were calculated. Pearson's correlation 
      test was applied to compare mortality rates and HDI for three periods: 1986-1995 
      was correlated with HDI of 1991, 1996-2005 with HDI of 2000, and 2006-2015 with 
      HDI of 2010; and to the correlation of AAPC versus the percentage change in HDI 
      from 1991 to 2010. RESULTS: A total of 209,425 deaths from pancreatic cancer were 
      reported in Brazil, with an annual increase of 1.5% in men and 1.9% in women. 
      There was an upward trend for mortality in most Brazilian states, with the 
      highest trends observed in the North and Northeast states. A positive correlation 
      between pancreatic mortality and HDI was observed over the three decades (r>0.80, 
      P<0.05) and also between AAPC and HDI improvement by sex (r=0.75 for men and 
      r=0.78 for women, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: There was an upward trend in pancreatic 
      cancer mortality in Brazil for both sexes, but rates among women were higher. 
      Mortality trends were higher in states with a higher percentage improvement in 
      HDI, such as the North and Northeast states.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a multisystemic disease, primarily affecting the 
      respiratory system. Liver involvement is frequent, but the impact on the clinical 
      course and outcomes are controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess liver 
      function at the admission and evaluate its effects on severity and mortality in 
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 
      hospitalized patients in a tertiary hospital in Brazil, with a PCR-confirmed 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection between April and October 2020. 1080 out of 1229 patients 
      had liver enzymes on admission and were divided in two cohorts, based on the 
      presence or absence of abnormal liver enzymes (ALE). Demographic, clinical, 
      laboratory, imaging, clinical severity, and mortality were evaluated. Patients 
      were followed until discharge, death or transfer to another institution. RESULTS: 
      Median age was 60 years and 51.5% were male. The more frequent comorbidities were 
      hypertension (51.2%), and diabetes (31.6%). Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis 
      were present in 8.6% and 2.3%, respectively. ALE (aminotransferases higher than 
      40 IU/L) were present in 56.9% of patients [mild (1-2 times): 63.9%; moderate 
      (2-5 times): 29.8%; severe (>5 times): 6.3%]. Male gender [RR 1.49, P=0.007], 
      increased total bilirubin [RR 1.18, P<0.001] and chronic liver disease [RR 1.47, 
      P=0.015] were predictors of abnormal aminotransferases on admission. Patients 
      with ALE had a higher risk of disease severity [RR 1.19; P=0.004]. There was no 
      association among ALE and mortality. CONCLUSION: ALE is common in COVID-19 
      hospitalized patients and were independently correlated with severe COVID-19. 
      Even mild ALE at admission may be a severity prognostic marker.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the correlation between the results obtained on the SEAL and 
      the Bayley III Scale and compare babies with and without delay in language 
      acquisition at 24 months concerning the performance obtained by them and their 
      mothers on the SEAL from 3 to 24 months. METHODS: The SEAL collection consists of 
      15-minute footages of 45 babies aged from 3 to 24 months old in interaction with 
      their mothers, who were assessed by two trained speech therapists for the use of 
      the SEAL. At 24 months, the 45 babies were assessed using the Bayley III Scale 
      and the item language was selected to classify them with and without delay. These 
      results were statistically analyzed through a Pearson's correlation test and a 
      Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In average, eighteen signs of typical development 
      as we obtained, while a mean of 12 delay signs were found. By comparing the 
      presence and absence of signs between the groups with and without delay in 
      language acquisition, eight signs from the baby and one from the mother differed 
      statistically in the sample. The analysis using the SEAL for cases of delay 
      showed that the maternal factor was as important as the infant factor to 
      understand the babies' language functioning. CONCLUSION: There was a significant 
      correlation between the SEAL performance from 3 to 24 months and the language 
      outcome at 24 months assessed by the Bayley III Scale in this sample.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke is a major cause of death and functional disability worldwide. 
      Knowledge of the associated factors is essential for defining education, 
      management, and healthcare strategies. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association 
      between arrival time at a neurology referral hospital (ATRH) and functional 
      disability in patients with ischemic stroke 90 days after the event. DESIGN AND 
      SETTING: Prospective cohort study conducted at a public institution of higher 
      education in Brazil. METHODS: This study included 241 people aged ≥ 18 years who 
      presented ischemic stroke. The exclusion criteria were death, inability to 
      communicate without companions who could answer the research questions, and > 10 
      days since ictus. Disability was assessed using the Rankin score (mR). Variables 
      for which associations showed a P value ≤ 0.20 in bivariate analysis were tested 
      as modifiers between ATRH and disability. Significant interaction terms were used 
      for multivariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
      performed with all variables, arriving at the complete model and adjusted beta 
      measures. The confounding variables were included in the robust logistic 
      regression model, and Akaike's Information Criterion was adopted to choose the 
      final model. The Poisson model assumes a statistical significance of 5% and risk 
      correction. RESULTS: Most participants (56.0%) arrived at the hospital within 4.5 
      hours of symptom onset, and 51.7% presented with mRs of 3 to 5 after 90 days of 
      ictus. In the multivariate model, ATRH ≥ 4.5 hours and females were associated 
      with more significant disability. CONCLUSIONS: Arrival at the referral hospital 
      4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms or wake-up stroke was an independent 
      predictor of a high degree of functional disability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying the relationship between maximum consumption of oxygen 
      and body fat percentage is important due to increased cardiovascular risk 
      factors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to verify the association between body fat 
      percentage determined by three predictive equations using anthropometric measures 
      (Lohman, Boileau, and Slaughter) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). We also 
      aimed to estimate the capacity of these equations for explaining VO2max 
      variations in adolescents according to sex. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a 
      cross-sectional study conducted in high schools in São José, Southern Brazil. 
      METHODS: This study included 879 adolescents (14-19 years) from Southern Brazil. 
      Aerobic fitness was assessed using the modified Canadian Aerobic Fitness Test. 
      The independent variable was body fat percentage predicted by the Lohman, 
      Boileau, and Slaughter equations. Analyses adjusted for sociodemographic 
      variables, physical activity level, and sexual maturation were performed with P 
      value < 0.05. RESULTS: All anthropometric prediction equations used to estimate 
      body fat percentage explained VO2max variations in adolescents. In male 
      adolescents, both regression models based on the Boileau et al.12 and Lohman10 
      equations revealed higher explanatory power for VO2max (20%) compared with that 
      based on the Slaughter et al.13 equation (19%). In female adolescents, the model 
      based on the anthropometric equation of Slaughter et al.13 showed the greatest 
      explanatory power for VO2max (18%). CONCLUSION: The inverse relationship between 
      VO2max and body fat intensifies the need for effective intervention programs that 
      prioritize maintenance of appropriate body fat and aerobic fitness levels because 
      inadequate levels of both factors result in negative health consequences.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the role of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 
      alpha (HIF-1α) and angiogenetic factor endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression in 
      regulating hypoxia and placental development by routine histopathological 
      methods. METHODS: Twenty preeclamptic and normal placentas were used. Placenta 
      tissue pieces were examined histopathologically after routine paraffin 
      follow-ups. HIF-1α and ET-1 proteins were examined immunohistochemically, and 
      placental tissues were examined ultrastructurally. RESULTS: Increase in syncytial 
      proliferation, endothelial damage in vessels, and increase in collagen were 
      observed in preeclamptic placentas. As a result of preeclampsia, an increase was 
      observed in HIF-1α and ET-1 protein levels in the placenta. Dilatation of 
      endoplasmic reticulum and loss of cristae in mitochondria were observed in 
      trophoblast cells in preeclamptic placental sections. CONCLUSIONS: High 
      regulation of oxygen resulting from preeclampsia has been shown to be a critical 
      determinant of placentagenesis and plays an important role in placental 
      differentiation, changes in maternal and fetal blood circulation, trophoblastic 
      invasion, and syncytial node increase. It has been thought that preeclampsia 
      affects secretion by disrupting the endoplasmic reticulum structure and induces 
      mitochondrial damage, and that ET-1 may potentially help in the induction of 
      stress pathways as a result of hypoxia in preeclampsia.

AB  - To determine the species composition, relative abundance and seasonal variation 
      of different mosquitoes Genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex, and Culiseta) 
      in different habitats the present research work was carried out in Entomology 
      Research Laboratory of The University of Peshawar. Sampling performed from 
      variety of permanent and temporary breeding habitats was carried out on monthly 
      basis from targeted breeding sites for two consecutive years through dipping 
      method. Species diversity in the survey sites was noted. Collection from these 
      seventeen various types of potential larval habitats, yielded a total of 42,430 
      immature constituting 41,556 larvae and 874 pupae. Among these only 19,651 adult 
      mosquitoes emerged comprising 11,512 female and 8,139 male mosquitoes. 78% (n= 
      15333) of mosquito larvae were from permanent and 22% (n=4318) were from 
      temporary breeding sites. This study showed that Peshawar valley harbours 15 
      species from the genera Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, Culex and Culiseta. When the 
      density of each species was examined, Culex quinquifasciatus was found to be 
      dominant (79%) and constant in distribution. Among the temporary habitats Aedes 
      albopictus was found as the most prevalent species particularly from tree holes 
      and water cisterns. The highest intensity of mosquitoes was in June (2243 emerged 
      adults) and November (2667 emerged adults) while the lowest was in January (203 
      emerged adults). A perfect positive correlation (r = +0.8) was found between 
      temperature and population of mosquitoes (df 10 and α 0.05). The species 
      diversity index for mosquitoes remained between 0.12 and 1.76. The Margalef's 
      richness components was noticeably low for bamboo traps (0.2) and fairly high for 
      rice fields, Percolating water and Animal tracks (1.3) which shows the abundance 
      of mosquito species in these habitats. Similarly Pielou's Evenness was highest 
      for bamboo traps (E=1) showing species uniform distribution. Animal tracks were 
      presumed not only the diverse habitat rather also possessed high value for 
      species richness and species evenness. Temperature, rainfall, humidity and other 
      related attributes responsible for species variation and abundance need to be 
      analysed further to pave way for controlling vector species in their oviposition 
      targeted sites.

PG  - 2212081
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2023.2212081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) is the leading cause of 
      nephrotic syndrome in the elderly. The treatment of idiopathic membranous 
      nephropathy is quite challenging due to the particularity of elderly patients. 
      This study intends to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and 
      initial therapeutic effect of idiopathic membranous nephropathy among elderly 
      patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of 67 elderly patients (58.2% male, 
      median age 69.0 years, range, 65-83 years) with biopsy-proven membranous 
      nephropathy was conducted at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital from 2016 to 
      2020. Data on clinicopathological characteristics and initial therapeutic effects 
      were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients, the mean eGFR of overall patients was 
      66.49 mL/min/1.73m(2) while the median urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) 
      and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) was 5676.73 mg/g and 2951.56 mg/g, 
      respectively. Pathological data revealed that the membranous Churg's stage II was 
      the most frequent (71.64%). Moreover, glomerular PLA2R antigen fluorescence 
      intensity of (+) and IgG4 antigen fluorescence intensity of (++) were detected in 
      63.6% and 86.4% of all patients, respectively. Overall, 44 patients, accounting 
      for 65.7%, achieved remission including complete remission and partial remission 
      within 1 year after renal biopsy. Compared with a non-remission group, the levels 
      of uPCR (6274.6 vs. 3235.6 mg/g, p = 0.007) and uACR (3433.6 vs. 1773.2 mg/g, 
      p = 0.017) were significantly higher in remission group. The proportion of 
      immunosuppressive therapy in the remission group was also higher (86.4% vs. 
      30.4%, p < 0.01). Compared with conservative treatment, patients with combined 
      treatment with glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide (CTX) or glucocorticoid and 
      calcineurin inhibitor (CNIs) achieved higher remission rate (glucocorticoid plus 
      cyclophosphamide vs. conservative treatment, 84.6% vs. 27.3%, p = 0.001; 
      glucocorticoid plus calcineurin inhibitor vs. conservative treatment, 88.0% vs. 
      27.3%, p < 0.001). Further analysis showed that compared with patients who 
      underwent conservative treatment, the proportion of males, the levels of uPCR, 
      uACR, BUN, Scr, CysC and PLA2R antigen-positive staining rate in kidney biopsy 
      were higher in those who underwent combined treatment with glucocorticoid and 
      CTX, while the levels of eGFR, TP and ALB were lower (p < 0.05). In addition, 
      patients who received combined treatment with glucocorticoid and CNIs had higher 
      levels of uPCR, uACR, TC and lower levels of TP, ALB than those who received 
      conservative treatment (p < 0.05). Moreover, there were no statistically 
      significant differences in the 1-year progression rate in eGFR between the 
      immunosuppressive treatment group and conservative treatment group (3.3 vs. 
      0.2 ml/min/1.73m(2), p = 0.852). CONCLUSIONS: Most elderly patients diagnosed 
      with IMN had multiple comorbidities, and the membranous Churg's stage II was most 
      common. The glomerular PLA2R and IgG4 antigen deposition were frequently detected 
      accompanied by glomerulosclerosis and severe tubulointerstitial injury. For 
      high-risk elderly patients with severe proteinuria, early initial 
      immunosuppressive therapy could achieve a higher urinary protein remission rate. 
      Therefore, it is crucial for clinicians to balance the risks and benefits of 
      immunosuppressive therapy based on clinical and pathological characteristics and 
      develop individualized treatment regimens for elderly patients with IMN.

TI  - The mechanism of circadian clock and its influence on animal circannual rhythm.
PG  - 409-424
LID - 10.16288/j.yczz.23-008 [doi]
AB  - The circadian clock exists in almost all life forms, and is an internal activity 
      generated by organisms adapting to the daily periodic changes of the external 
      environment. The circadian clock is regulated by the 
      transcription-translation-negative feedback loop in the body, which can regulate 
      the activities of tissues and organs. Its normal maintenance is important for the 
      health, growth, and reproduction of organisms. In contrast, due to the season 
      changes of the environment, organisms have also formed annual cycle physiological 
      changes in their bodies, such as seasonal estrus, etc. The annual rhythm of 
      living things is mainly affected by environmental factors such as photoperiod, 
      and is related to gene expression, hormone content, morphological changes of cell 
      and tissues in vivo. Melatonin is an important signal to recognize the changes of 
      photoperiod, and the circadian clock plays an important role in the pituitary to 
      interpret the signal of melatonin and regulate the changes of downstream signals, 
      which plays an important guiding role in the recognition of annual changes in the 
      environment and the generation of the body's annual rhythm. In this review, we 
      summarize the progress of research on the mechanism of action of circadian clocks 
      in influencing annual rhythms, by introducing the mechanisms of circadian and 
      annual rhythms generation in insects and mammals, and in the context of annual 
      rhythms in birds, with the aim of providing a broader range of ideas for future 
      research on the mechanism of annual rhythms influence.

PG  - 379-394
LID - 10.16288/j.yczz.23-018 [doi]
AB  - DNA damage is one of the key factors affecting gametogenesis and embryo 
      development. Oocytes are susceptible to DNA damage induced by various endogenous 
      and exogenous factors (e.g., reactive oxygen species, radiation, chemotherapeutic 
      agents, etc.). Current research has revealed that oocytes at various 
      developmental stages are able to respond to various types of DNA damage, 
      repairing DNA or initiating apoptosis through complex mechanisms. Primordial 
      follicular oocytes are more susceptible to apoptosis induced by DNA damage than 
      oocytes entering the growth stage. DNA damage is less likely to induce arrest of 
      the meiotic maturation process in oocytes, however the developmental capacity of 
      oocytes carrying DNA damage is significantly reduced. In clinical practice, 
      aging, radiation and chemotherapy are common causes of oocyte DNA damage, reduced 
      ovarian reserve and infertility in women. Therefore, various methods that can 
      reduce DNA damage and enhance DNA repair in oocytes have been tried in an attempt 
      to protect oocytes. In this review, we systematically summarize the mechanisms of 
      DNA damage and repair in mammalian oocytes at various developmental stages and 
      discuss their potential clinical value with the aim to provide new strategies for 
      fertility protection.

TI  - Impact of sleep-wake features on fatigue among female shift work nurses.
PG  - 2210843
LID - 10.1080/07853890.2023.2210843 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance and fatigue are prevalent in nurses. Little is 
      known about the characteristics of shift work nurses' sleep-wake features and 
      their subsequent impact on work performance. The study aimed to describe the 
      characteristics of the sleep-wake index, reaction time, saliva cortisol level, 
      and fatigue severity among female shift work nurses. METHODS: This is a 
      cross-sectional exploratory study. A convenience sample of 152 female nurses 
      (8-hour day-evening-night, n = 70; 12-hour day-night, n = 82) participated in 
      this study from nine intensive care units (ICUs) from two teaching hospitals in 
      Beijing, China. A consecutive 7-day actigraphy data were used to analyse 
      sleep-wake indexes, including total sleep time (TST) and circadian activity 
      rhythms (CAR). Before and after shifts, the following data were collected, 
      psychomotor vigilance task for reaction time, saliva cortisol for the level of 
      alertness, and self-reported fatigue severity with the Lee Fatigue Scale-Short 
      Form. RESULTS: All nurses reported clinically significant fatigue severity. 
      Compared with the 8-hour shift nurses, the 12-hour shift nurses had significantly 
      more TST (456 vs. 364 min), higher saliva cortisol levels before the day shift 
      (0.54 vs. 0.31), but longer reaction time before the night shift (286 vs. 
      277 ms). In both shifts, those with better CAR had significantly longer TST. 
      CONCLUSION: Female nurses experienced fatigue and desynchronized CAR, especially 
      nurses on a 12-hour shift. The CAR-friendly shift work schedule is needed to 
      minimize the health and safety impacts of circadian misalignment for nurses.Key 
      messagesThis is the first use of consecutive 7-day actigraphy data to explore the 
      link between sleep disturbances as a stressor to CAR, salivary cortisol, and 
      reaction time among clinical nurses.CAR may be a helpful indicator for overworked 
      nurses, and it can serve as a modifiable target for interventions to enhance 
      nurses' well-being.

AB  - The risk of developing or exacerbating psychiatric disorders increases in the 
      perinatal period. However, there is a concern that psychotropic medications may 
      be withheld from appropriate treatment by doctors, or patients or their families 
      because of concerns about their effects on the fetus or infant. This article 
      describes psychiatric disorders with risk of perinatal onset or exacerbation and 
      presents the risks and benefits of standard pharmacotherapy to the fetus and 
      infant. It is essential to consult with the patient and family before conception 
      to make shared decisions based on correct information.

AB  - Specific therapy for genetic myopathy is still limited to enzyme replacement 
      therapy for Pompe disease with alglucosidase alfa and avalglucosidase alfa, and 
      exon skipping therapy with antisense nucleotide viltolarsen for about 7% of 
      patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Corticosteroid treatment 
      (predonisolone 10-15mg/day) to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, from the age of 5-6 
      years old, regardless of mutations. Continuation of corticosteroid after loss of 
      ambulation is controversial. Becker muscular dystrophy patients and manifesting 
      female carriers of DMD mutation may also benefit from corticosteroid, but adverse 
      effects should be avoided. In other types of muscular dystrophy, usefulness of 
      corticosteroid has been reported but may be more limited. Drug therapy should be 
      added on the basis of appropriate evaluation and fundamental symptomatic 
      treatment including rehabilitation, in genetic myopathy.

      the seizure types. The seizure types are roughly classified into focal onset and 
      generalized onset (generalized tonic-clonic, absence, and generalized myoclonic) 
      seizures. Due care should be taken when selecting an ASD for patients with 
      comorbidities and women of child-bearing age. If seizures persist after 2 or more 
      trials with an appropriate ASD at optimal doses, the patients should be referred 
      to epileptologists.

AB  - We investigated parasitic zoonoses caused by protozoans and helminths in urban 
      and peri-urban rat populations (Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus) in Spanish 
      cities. Rats were trapped and then dissected to remove adult helminths, and the 
      contents of the large intestine were retrieved for the study of parasitic forms. 
      The Midi Parasep® solvent free (SF) technique was used to concentrate the 
      parasites in the intestinal contents. Some of the rats studied (n = 8) were 
      infected by the rat lungworm, Angiostongylus cantonensis, whose first stage 
      larvae (L1) are shed in rat faeces. After the concentration technique, L1 larvae 
      were found in the sediment of 6 of the 8 positive rats. The two negative sediment 
      samples were due to the presence of either only adult females or, in addition to 
      males, only young females in the lungs of the rats. In view of our results, Midi 
      Parasep® SF turned out to be a simple, rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive method 
      to detect nematode larvae, such as the L1 larvae of A. cantonensis (or A. 
      costaricensis), in natural and experimentally infected rats.

PG  - 20230108
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2023.0108 [doi]
AB  - Life-cycle stages are not always capable of evolving independently from each 
      other, but it remains unclear if evolving to meet the demands of one stage 
      actually imposes costs on other stages. Male ornamentation is a useful trait in 
      which to test this potential evolutionary constraint because ornaments improve 
      reproduction in the adult stage but can require the expression of risky traits in 
      the juvenile stage. Here, I compared larval mortality between populations of 
      ornamented and non-ornamented dragonfly species. Since males produce more 
      exaggerated melanin wing ornaments than females, I tested if larval mortality of 
      males is higher in populations of species that have evolved adult male wing 
      ornamentation. My analyses uncover male-biased larval mortality in species that 
      have evolved male ornamentation. These findings indicate that evolving to 
      optimize mating for the adult stage imposes a cost to survival in the larval 
      stage. Thus, this study reveals that evolution in one life-cycle stage can impose 
      fitness costs on other stages that persist over macroevolutionary timescales.

TI  - Dopamine mediates the pea aphid wing plasticity.
PG  - 20230024
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2023.0024 [doi]
AB  - Many organisms exhibit phenotypic plasticity, in which developmental processes 
      result in different phenotypes depending on their environmental context. Here we 
      focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying that environmental response. Pea 
      aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) exhibit a wing dimorphism, in which pea aphid 
      mothers produce winged or wingless daughters when exposed to a crowded or 
      low-density environment, respectively. We investigated the role of dopamine in 
      mediating this wing plasticity, motivated by a previous study that found higher 
      dopamine titres in wingless- versus winged-producing aphid mothers. In this 
      study, we found that manipulating dopamine levels in aphid mothers affected the 
      numbers of winged offspring they produced. Specifically, asexual female adults 
      injected with a dopamine agonist produced a lower percentage of winged offspring, 
      while asexual females injected with a dopamine antagonist produced a higher 
      percentage of winged offspring, matching expectations based on the titre 
      difference. We also found that genes involved in dopamine synthesis, degradation 
      and signalling were not differentially expressed between wingless- and 
      winged-producing aphids. This result indicates that titre regulation possibly 
      happens in a non-transcriptional manner or that sampling of additional timepoints 
      or tissues is necessary. Overall, our work emphasizes that dopamine is an 
      important component of how organisms process information about their 
      environments.

TI  - Multimodal duetting in katydids under bat predation risk: a winning strategy for 
      both sexes.
PG  - 20230110
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2023.0110 [doi]
AB  - Duetting is a behaviour observed in some animal species, in which both males and 
      females participate in signalling to find mates. It may have evolved as an 
      adaptation to reduce the costs associated with mate-finding behaviours, such as 
      predation risk. Duetting systems allow estimation of sex-specific predation risks 
      of signalling and searching in the same species, giving insights into the 
      selective forces acting on these behaviours. Using an acoustic-vibratory duetting 
      katydid, Onomarchus uninotatus, and its bat predator, Megaderma spasma, we 
      estimated the sex-specific predation costs of different mate-finding behaviours, 
      such as walking, flying and signalling, by conducting experiments with untethered 
      live katydids and bats. We found that acoustic-vibratory duetting benefits both 
      the sexes as a low-risk mate-finding strategy.

AB  - Updates in whole genome sequencing technologies have revealed various RNA 
      modifications in cancer, among which RNA methylation is a frequent 
      posttranscriptional modification. RNA methylation is essential for regulating 
      biological processes such as RNA transcription, splicing, structure, stability, 
      and translation. Its dysfunction is strongly associated with the development of 
      human malignancies. Research advances with respect to the regulatory role of RNA 
      modifications in ovarian cancer include N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 
      5-methylcytosine (m5C), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), and N7-methylguanosine (m7G). 
      Numerous studies have demonstrated that epigenetic modifications of RNA can 
      influence the progression and metastasis of ovarian cancer and may provide 
      excellent targets for cancer therapy. This review highlights advances in research 
      on RNA methylation modifications and ovarian cancer prognosis, carcinogenesis, 
      and resistance, which could provide a theoretical foundation for designing 
      therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer based on RNA methylation modifications.

TI  - Rapidly Progressing Sarcomatoid Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Needle Biopsy and 
      Radiofrequency Ablation.
PG  - e939126
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.939126 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare, primary malignant 
      liver cancer. Its pathogenesis is unknown, but it often occurs in patients who 
      have undergone repeated antitumor therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma. 
      Sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma is more likely to recur and has a worse 
      prognosis than that of hepatocellular carcinoma. As no specific features have 
      been identified in the symptoms, serological findings, or imaging findings, it is 
      difficult to accurately diagnose the disease before surgical resection or 
      autopsy. CASE REPORT An 83-year-old woman was diagnosed with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma 20 years ago. Radiofrequency ablation was initially performed. 
      Thereafter, invasive, non-surgical treatments were repeated. The most recent 
      treatment was 4 years ago, during which computed tomography suggested recurrent 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. However, upon needle biopsy, histological examination 
      revealed spindle-shaped tumor cells and actively mitotic cells. 
      Immunohistochemical analysis showed negative results for Arginase-1, HepPar1, and 
      Glypican3 and positive results for AE1/AE3, CK7, and vimentin. Therefore, 
      sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed, which was treated with 
      radiofrequency ablation but progressed rapidly thereafter. Considering the rapid 
      disease progression, the patient was treated conservatively. However, the 
      patient's general condition gradually deteriorated, resulting in death. 
      CONCLUSIONS Compared with hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular 
      carcinoma is more prone to recurrence and has a poorer prognosis. Therefore, 
      aggressive surgical resection seems to be the most appropriate treatment for 
      sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma at present. Additional hepatic resection or 
      follow-up imaging in a short period should be considered at the time of diagnosis 
      of sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma by biopsy, considering the risk of 
      seeding or recurrence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Placental pathology is a well-known cause of perinatal and neonatal 
      mortality and morbidity, and may correlate with placental growth, which can be 
      assessed indirectly by anthropometric placental measurements. The aim of this 
      cross-sectional study was to investigate mean placental weight and its 
      relationship with birthweight and maternal body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Fresh 
      (not formalin fixed) consecutively delivered placentae of term newborns (37-42 
      weeks), collected between February 2022 and August 2022, and the mothers and 
      newborns, were included. Mean placental weight, birthweight and maternal BMI were 
      calculated. Pearson's correlation coefficient, linear regression, and one-way 
      analysis of variance were used to analyse continuous and categorical data. 
      RESULTS: Out of 390 samples, 211 placentae (with 211 newborns and mothers) were 
      included in this study after exclusion criteria were applied. Mean placental 
      weight was 494.45 ± 110.39 g, and mean term birth weight/placental weight ratio 
      was 6.21 ± 1.21 (range, 3.35-11.62 g). Placental weight was positively correlated 
      with birthweight and maternal BMI, but not with newborn sex. Linear regression 
      effect estimation of placental weight on birthweight revealed a medium 
      correlation (R(2) = 0.212; formula, 1.4553 × X + 2246.7, where X is placental 
      weight [g]). CONCLUSION: Placental weight was revealed to positively correlate 
      with birthweight and maternal BMI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Higher education students express high levels of suicidal ideation. 
      However, data on students' knowledge of suicide and attitudes toward seeking 
      professional psychological help are lacking. Therefore, a cross-sectional study 
      was conducted to evaluate students' suicidal ideation, suicide literacy and 
      attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help, and to assess whether 
      these variables were interrelated. METHODS: Higher education students completed 
      an online survey that consisted of 12 questions on suicide literacy (based on the 
      Literacy of Suicide Scale), the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional 
      Psychological Help Scale and the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale. RESULTS: A 
      total of 2004 students completed the survey. Female students and biomedical 
      students showed the highest suicide literacy and most positive help-seeking 
      attitudes. Higher study year was associated with more positive help-seeking 
      attitudes. Art students expressed the highest levels of suicidal ideation. 
      Suicide literacy had a weak positive correlation with help-seeking attitudes 
      (Spearman's rho = 0.186). CONCLUSIONS: Suicidal ideation, suicide literacy and 
      help-seeking attitudes may differ according to student's gender, study year and 
      study field. Better suicide literacy may promote psychological help-seeking 
      behavior.

TI  - Pilots' Spatial Visualization Ability Assessment Based on Virtual Reality.
PG  - 422-428
LID - 10.3357/AMHP.6198.2023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the 
      mental rotation test (MRT) based on virtual reality (VR) in predicting pilots' 
      spatial visualization ability (SVA).METHODS: Based on VR, 118 healthy pilots' SVA 
      were evaluated by MRT. The pilot flight ability evaluation scale was used as the 
      criterion of test validity. According to the scale score, pilots were divided 
      into high, middle, or low spatial ability groups pursuant to the 27% allocation 
      principle. Differences in reaction time (RT), correct rate (CR), and correct 
      number per second (CNPS) of MRT between groups were compared. Correlations 
      between scale scores and MRT scores were analyzed. RT, CR, and CNPS of MRT among 
      different age groups and between genders were also compared.RESULTS: The RT of 
      the high spatial ability group was remarkably slower than that of the low spatial 
      ability group (363.4 ± 140.2 s, 458.1 ± 151.7 s). The CNPS of the high spatial 
      ability group was dramatically higher than that of the low spatial ability group 
      (0.111 ± 0.045 s, 0.086 ± 0.001 s). There were no significant differences in RT, 
      CR, and CNPS between different genders. Pilots in the 29-35 yr old age group had 
      considerably slower RT than those in the 22-28 yr old age group (330.8 ± 140.3 s, 
      417.2 ± 132.7 s). Pilots in the 29-35 yr old age group had conspicuously higher 
      CNPS than pilots in the 22-28 yr old age group (0.119 ± 0.040 s, 
      0.096 ± 0.036 s). All pilots' scale scores were positively correlated with CNPS 
      (r = 0.254) and negatively correlated with RT (r = -0.234).DISCUSSION: MRT based 
      on VR has a good discrimination efficacy for SVA of pilots and is a good 
      indicator for the SVA component measurement.Zhang M, Wang M, Feng H, Liu X, Zhai

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of COVID-19 on the implementation of bundled 
      interventions to improve the engagement and retention of Black women in HIV care. 
      METHODS: Pre-implementation interviews conducted between January and April 202 L 
      with 12 demonstration sites implementing bundled interventions for Black women 
      with HIV. Directed content analysis was employed to examine the site interview 
      transcripts. RESULTS: The pandemic intensified barriers to care and harmful 
      social conditions. However, COVID-19 also forced pivots in health care and social 
      service delivery and some of these changes benefited Black women living with HIV. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The continuation of policies that support the material needs of 
      Black women with HIV and ease access to care is critical. Racial capitalism 
      impedes the enactment of these policies and thus threatens public health.

TI  - The Child Healthcare at MATER Pediatric Study (CHAMPS): a 2-arm cluster 
      randomized control trial of group well child care for mothers in treatment for 
      opioid use disorder and their children.
PG  - 333
LID - 10.1186/s13063-023-07357-2 [doi]
LID - 333
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that group-based well child care-a shared medical 
      appointment where families come together as a group to receive pediatric primary 
      care-increases patient-reported satisfaction and adherence to recommended care. 
      Evidence supporting the use of group well child care for mothers with opioid use 
      disorder, however, is lacking. The overall objective of the Child Healthcare at 
      MATER Pediatric Study (CHAMPS) trial is to evaluate a group model of well child 
      care for mothers with opioid use disorder and their children. METHODS: CHAMPS is 
      a single-site 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. A total of 108 
      mother-child dyads will be enrolled into the study. Twenty-six clusters of 
      approximately 4 mother-infant dyads each will be randomized 1:1 to one of two 
      study arms (intervention or control). Clustering will be based on child's month 
      of birth. In the intervention arm, group well child care will be provided on-site 
      at a maternal substance use disorder treatment program. Mother-child dyads in the 
      control arm will receive individual well child care from one nearby pediatric 
      primary care clinic. Dyads in both study arms will be followed prospectively for 
      18 months, and data will be compared between the two study arms. Primary outcomes 
      include well child care quality and utilization, child health knowledge, and 
      parenting quality. DISCUSSION: The CHAMPS trial will provide evidence to 
      determine if a group well child care offered on-site at an opioid treatment 
      program for pregnant and parenting women is beneficial over individual well child 
      care for families impacted by maternal opioid use disorder. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

PG  - 338
LID - 10.1186/s12909-023-04298-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of online 
      problem-based learning (e-PBL) with multimedia animation scenarios by comparing 
      the face-to-face (f2f) PBL method with paper-based scenarios. Adapting different 
      f2f teaching methodologies to online environments is a significant problem that 
      urgently needs attention, particularly in health education. METHODS: This study 
      is part of design-based research and consists of three phases, which comprise 
      design, analysis, and re-design. First, the animation-based problem scenarios 
      were developed, and the learning environment (e-PBL) elements were organized. 
      Then animation-based scenarios and the e-PBL environment were used, and problems 
      related to the use of the environment were determined with an experimental study 
      which was based on a pretest-posttest control group design. Finally, we used the 
      following three measurement tools in the data collection process: a scale to 
      determine the effectiveness of PBL, an attitude scale toward PBL, and the 
      Clinical Objective Reasoning Exams (CORE). The study group in this research 
      comprised 92 medical undergraduates (47 female and 45 male). RESULTS: There were 
      similar scores between the two groups (e-PBL and f2f) in terms of the 
      effectiveness of the platforms, the attitudes of the medical undergraduates, and 
      the CORE scores. Also, there were positive relationships between the attitude 
      scores, grade point average (GPA), and PBL scores of the undergraduates. Another 
      significant positive relationship was found between the CORE scores and the GPA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The animation-supported e-PBL environment positively effects the 
      participants' knowledge, skills, and attitude. Students who have high academic 
      scores attitude positively towards e-PBL. Providing problem scenarios as 
      multimedia animations is the innovative face of the research. They have been 
      produced inexpensively with off-the-shelf web-based animation apps. These 
      technological advances may democratize the production of video-based cases in the 
      future. Although the results of this study were obtained before the pandemic, 
      they showed no differences between e-PBL and f2f-PBL in terms of effectiveness.

TI  - Live birth rates following individualized dosing algorithm of follitropin delta 
      in a long GnRH agonist protocol.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s12958-023-01090-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the efficacy and safety of individualized follitropin delta 
      dosing, based on serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentration and bodyweight, 
      in a long gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist protocol. METHODS: 
      Clinical outcomes after one treatment cycle are reported in women with AMH: 5-35 
      pmol/L. Oocytes were inseminated by intracytoplasmic sperm injection, blastocyst 
      transfer was on Day 5 and remaining blastocysts were cryopreserved. Data 
      collection included live births and neonatal health follow-up for all 
      fresh/frozen transfers performed within one year after treatment allocation. 
      RESULTS: In total, 104 women started stimulation, of whom 101 had oocyte recovery 
      and 92 had blastocyst transfer. The average daily dose of follitropin delta was 
      11.0 ± 1.6 µg and the duration of stimulation was 10.3 ± 1.6 days. The mean 
      number of oocytes was 12.5 ± 6.4, the mean number of blastocysts was 5.1 ± 3.4, 
      and 85% had at least one good-quality blastocyst. Following mostly single 
      blastocyst transfer (95%), the ongoing pregnancy rate was 43%, the live-birth 
      rate was 43%, and the cumulative live-birth rate was 58% per started stimulation. 
      There were 6 cases of early OHSS (5.8%) graded as mild (n = 3) and moderate 
      (n = 3) and 6 cases of late OHSS (5.8%) graded as moderate (n = 3) and severe 
      (n = 3). CONCLUSION: In this first evaluation of the individualized follitropin 
      delta dosing in a long GnRH agonist protocol, the cumulative live-birth rate was 
      high. A randomized trial comparing follitropin delta in a long GnRH agonist 
      protocol versus in a GnRH antagonist protocol should provide further insight into 
      the efficacy and safety of this treatment option. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: This study investigated the clinicopathological characteristics 
      and treatment of appendix neuroendocrine neoplasms in appendectomy specimens of 
      our center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinicopathological data, including age, 
      sex, preoperative clinical manifestation, surgical method, and histopathological 
      examination results of 11 patients with appendix neuroendocrine neoplasms 
      confirmed by surgery and pathology between November 2005 and January 2023, were 
      retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: In the histopathological examination of 7277 
      appendectomy specimens, 11 cases (0.2%) had appendix neuroendocrine neoplasms. 
      Among the 11 patients, 8(72.7%) were males, and 3(27.3%) were females, with an 
      average age of 48.1 years. All patients underwent emergency surgery. A total of 9 
      patients underwent open appendectomy, including 1 patient who underwent 
      second-stage simple right hemicolectomy after an appendectomy, and two who 
      underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. All 11 patients were followed up for a 
      period of 1 to 17 years. All patients survived without any indication of tumor 
      recurrence. CONCLUSION: Appendiceal neuroendocrine neoplasms are low-grade 
      malignant tumors originating from neuroendocrine cells. They are rarely seen in 
      clinical practice and are often treated based on acute and chronic appendicitis 
      symptoms. These tumors are challenging to diagnose before surgery due to the lack 
      of specificity in clinical manifestations and auxiliary examinations. The 
      diagnosis generally depends on postoperative pathology and immunohistochemistry. 
      Despite the diagnostic challenges, these tumors have a favorable prognosis.

AB  - SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (SDUS) is a highly invasive 
      single-gene malignant tumor caused by mutations in the SMARCA4 gene. SDUS has a 
      poor prognosis, with no established treatment strategy at present. Further, there 
      is a lack of relevant research on the role of the immune microenvironment in SDUS 
      worldwide. Here, we report a case of SDUS that was diagnosed and analysed using 
      morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular detection techniques, along 
      with the analysis of the immune microenvironment. By immunohistochemistry, the 
      tumor cells showed retained INI-1 expression, focal CD10 expression, and loss of 
      BRG1, CK-pan, synaptophysin, desmin, and ER expression. Further, some of the 
      immune cells expressing CD3 and CD8 had infiltrated into the SDUS, but no PD-L1 
      expression was detected. The multiple immunofluorescent staining results showed 
      that a proportion of the immune cells and SDUS cells expressed 
      CD8/CD68/PD-1/PD-L1. Therefore, our report will help in the diagnostic awareness 
      of SDUS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in women. 
      Identifying and avoiding the preventable risk factors of BC reduces its 
      occurrence effectively. So, this study aimed to assess BC's risk factors and risk 
      perception status in Babol, Northern Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional study 
      was conducted on 400 women aged 18 to 70 in Babol, Northern Iran. According to 
      the eligibility criteria, the selected participants completed the demographic 
      characteristics and researcher-made valid and reliable questionnaires. The 
      statistical software was SPSS20. RESULTS: The significant risk factors related to 
      BC were old age (60 years old and more) (30.2%), obesity (25.8%), history of 
      radiation (10%), and familial history of BC (9.5%), respectively (P < 0.05). 
      Suspected symptoms of BC were observed in 78 (19.5%) women, including 
      indentations in 27 (6.75%), redness in 15 (3.75%), pain in 16 (4%), and 
      enlargement of lymph nodes in 20 (5%). The BC risk perception score was 
      107.72±13.22. CONCLUSION: Most participants had at least one risk factor for BC. 
      It is essential to implement intervention programs to control obesity and BC 
      screening programs in obese and overweight women to prevent BC and its 
      complications. Further studies are needed.

TI  - Large retroperitoneal extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma with renal pedicle invasion: 
      a case report.
PG  - 95

LID - 95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma (EES) is a rare malignant tumor 
      primarily found in children and young adults. Localized disease can present with 
      nonspecific symptoms such as local mass, regional pain, and increased skin 
      temperature. More severe cases may present with systemic symptoms such as 
      malaise, weakness, fever, anemia, and weight loss. Among these lesions, 
      retroperitoneal sarcomas are relatively uncommon and difficult to diagnose. Since 
      they are usually asymptomatic until large enough to compress or invade the 
      surrounding tissues, most are already advanced at first detection. Traditionally, 
      the treatment of choice is complete surgical resection, sometimes combined with 
      postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We report a case of EES with left 
      renal artery invasion in the left retroperitoneal cavity successfully treated 
      with transarterial embolization and surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old 
      woman with a negative family history of cancer presented at our Urology 
      Department with a large left retroperitoneal tumor found by magnetic resonance 
      imaging during the health exam. Physical examination showed a soft abdomen and no 
      palpable mass or tenderness. Imaging studies showed that the tumor covered the 
      entire left renal pedicle, but the left kidney, left adrenal gland, and pancreas 
      appeared tumor free. Since the tumor tightly covered the entire renal pedicle, 
      tumor excision with radical nephrectomy was advised. The patient underwent 
      transarterial embolization of the left renal artery with 10 mg of Gelfoam pieces 
      daily before surgical excision. Tumor excision and left radical nephrectomy were 
      uneventful the day after embolization. Post-operatively, the patient recovered 
      well and was discharged on day 10. The final histopathological analysis showed a 
      round blue cell tumor consistent with an Ewing sarcoma, and the surgical margins 
      were tumor free. CONCLUSIONS: Retroperitoneal malignancies are rare but usually 
      severe conditions. Our case report showed that retroperitoneal EES with renal 
      artery invasion could be treated safely with transarterial embolization and 
      surgery.

TI  - Cost-utility analysis of different venous access devices in breast cancer 
      patients: a decision-based analysis model.
PG  - 497
LID - 10.1186/s12913-023-09517-1 [doi]
LID - 497
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous access devices commonly used in clinical practice for 
      long-term chemotherapy of breast cancer include central venous catheters (CVCs), 
      peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), and implantable venous 
      access ports (IVAPs). CVCs and PICCs are less costly to place but have a higher 
      complication rate than IVAPs. However, there is a lack of cost-utility 
      comparisons among the three devices. The aim of this study was to assess the 
      cost-effectiveness of three catheters for long-term chemotherapy in breast cancer 
      patients. METHODS: This study used propensity score matching (PSM) to establish a 
      retrospective cohort. Decision tree models were used to compare the 
      cost-effectiveness of three different intravenous lines in breast cancer 
      chemotherapy patients. Cost parameters were derived from data extracted from the 
      outpatient and inpatient charging systems, and total costs included costs of 
      placement, maintenance, extraction, and handling of complications; utility 
      parameters were derived from previous cross-sectional survey results of the 
      research group; and complication rates were derived from breast cancer 
      catheterization patient information as well as follow-up information. 
      Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured for efficacy outcomes. 
      Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to compare the three 
      strategies. To assess uncertainty in model parameters, sensitivity analyses 
      (univariate sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis) were 
      performed. RESULTS: A total of 10,718 patients (3780 after propensity score 
      matching) were included. IVAPs had the smallest cost-utility ratio, and PICCs had 
      the largest cost-utility ratio when left in place for more than 12 months. The 
      incremental cost-utility ratio of PICC to CVC was $2375.08/QALY, IVAP to PICC was 
      $522.01/QALY, and IVAP to CVC was $612.98/QALY. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratios showed that IVAPs were more effective than CVCs and PICCs. Model 
      regression analysis showed that the IVAP was recommended as the best regimen 
      regardless of the catheter indwelling time (6 months, 12 months or more than 12 
      months). The reliability and stability of the model were verified by 
      single-factor sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation (probabilistic 
      sensitivity analysis). CONCLUSION: This study provides economic evidence for the 
      selection of vascular access in breast cancer chemotherapy patients. In the case 
      of limited resources in China, establishing a decision tree model comparing the 
      cost-effectiveness of three vascular access devices for breast cancer 
      chemotherapy patients determined that the IVAP was the most cost-effective 
      regimen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current study focuses on the mediator role of abusive behaviour 
      in romantic relationships (ABRR) in the relationship between subordination, 
      retreat, and relationship satisfaction and the moderation role of relatedness and 
      autonomy in the relationships between ABRR and relationship satisfaction. 
      METHODS: 333 (91 men, 242 women) Turkish emerging adults in relationships 
      participated in this research. These participants completed a measure of abusive 
      behaviour in romantic relationship, conflict resolution styles, relationship 
      satisfaction and need satisfaction in romantic relationship. Models 1 and 4 of 
      Process Hayes were used in SPSS 22 to investigate moderation and mediation roles. 
      RESULTS: According to the results, ABRR has a full mediator role in the 
      relationship between subordination and relationship satisfaction and has a 
      partial mediator role in the relationship between retreat and relationship 
      satisfaction. Another result of the study showed that ABRR negatively affected 
      relationship satisfaction and that relatedness and autonomy moderated this 
      relationship. Moderator roles are strong when the level of relatedness and 
      autonomy are high. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, subordination and retreat as well 
      as ABRR are risk factors for relationship satisfaction for individuals in 
      romantic relationships. Our results suggest that relatedness and autonomy present 
      an adaptive approach and protection method associated with improved relationship 
      satisfaction. Therefore, subordination, withdrawal, ABRR, autonomy, and 
      relatedness should be considered in relationship satisfaction assessment and 
      couple therapies.

      mimicking a cyst.
PG  - 297
LID - 10.1186/s12903-023-03008-9 [doi]
LID - 297
AB  - BACKGROUND: Odontogenic fibroma (OF) is a rare benign odontogenic tumor of 
      ectomesenchymal origin, mostly affecting the tooth-bearing portions of the jaws 
      in middle-aged patients. Whilst small lesions tend to be clinically asymptomatic, 
      varying unspecific clinical symptoms occur with an increase in size and may mimic 
      odontogenic or other maxillofacial bone tumors, cysts, or fibro-osseous lesions 
      of the jaws. CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old female patient presented with a 
      hard, non-fluctuating protrusion in the vestibule of the upper right maxilla. It 
      was visualized on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) as space-occupying 
      osteolysis with the displacement of the floor and facial wall of the maxillary 
      sinus, mimicking a cyst-like lesion. The tissue was surgically removed and 
      identified as an OF in the histopathological examination. One year after the 
      surgery, restitution of regular sinus anatomy and physiological intraoral 
      findings were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This case report emphasizes that rare 
      entities, like the maxillary OF presented, often demonstrate nonspecific clinical 
      and radiological findings. Nevertheless, clinicians need to consider rare 
      entities as possible differential diagnoses and plan the treatment accordingly. 
      Histopathological examination is essential to conclude the diagnosis. OF rarely 
      recur after proper enucleation.

TI  - Pregnant woman awareness of obstetric danger signs in developing country: 
      systematic review.
PG  - 357
LID - 10.1186/s12884-023-05674-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mother's awareness of obstetric danger signs is the degree of a 
      pregnant woman to fully utilize her knowledge of the signs and symptoms of 
      complications of pregnancy, which helps the mother and family to seek medical 
      help immediately. High maternal and infant mortality rates in developing 
      countries are due to a combination of a lack of quality, resources and access to 
      health services coupled with mother's lack of awareness. The purpose of this 
      study was to collect current empirical studies to describe the pregnant women 
      awareness about the obstetric danger sign in developing country. METHOD: This 
      review employed the Prisma-ScR checklist. The articles searched in four 
      electronic databases (Scopus, CINAHL, Science Direct, Google Scholar). Variables 
      that used to search the articles (pregnant woman, knowledge, awareness, danger 
      signs pregnancy). The Framework used to review is PICOS. RESULT: The results of 
      the article found 20 studies which met inclusion criteria. The determinants were 
      high educational status, more pregnancy experience, more ANC visit, and labour in 
      the health facility. CONCLUSION: The level of awareness is low to medium, only 
      some have fair awareness, in which related to determinant. The recommended 
      effective strategy is to improve the ANC program by assess the risk of obstetric 
      danger sign promptly, assess the barrier of health seeking related to the family 
      support, i.e. the husband and the elderly. Additionally, use MCH handbook or 
      mobile application to record the ANC visit and communicate with the family.

      ascites: a rare case report.
PG  - 97
LID - 10.1186/s13048-023-01186-2 [doi]
LID - 97
AB  - BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, both ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and 
      pregnancy luteoma could manifest as massive ascites, enlarged ovaries, or 
      elevated serum levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), and atypical cells may be 
      found in the ascitic fluid of OHSS patients. Whether this should be treated 
      aggressively as peritoneal carcinomatosis is controversial. CASE PRESENTATION: A 
      35-year-old G2P1A1 woman with secondary infertility had a successful pregnancy 
      after one cycle of assisted reproductive technology. The patient complained of 
      lower abdominal distension, oliguria, and poor appetite 19 days after embryo 
      transplantation. She was diagnosed with late-onset OHSS. Although the size of the 
      ovaries decreased bilaterally to the normal range at 12 weeks of gestation after 
      prompt medical care, the ascites increased again after an initial decreasing 
      trend. Elevated serum levels of CA125 (191.1 IU/mL), and suspected adenocarcinoma 
      cells were observed in the ascitic fluid. Although further magnetic resonance 
      imaging examination or diagnostic laparoscopy was recommended, the patient was 
      provided with supportive treatment and closely monitored upon her request. 
      Surprisingly, her ascites diminished, and serum level of CA125 started to decline 
      at 19 weeks of gestation. During cesarean section, pathological examination of 
      the solid mass in the right ovary revealed pregnancy luteoma, which was 
      presumably the other cause of the intractable ascites. CONCLUSIONS: Caution 
      should be exercised in cases of suspicious malignant ascites during pregnancy. 
      This may due to OHSS or pregnancy luteoma, in which abnormalities usually regress 
      spontaneously.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the paternal genetic intergenerational 
      and transgenerational genetic effects of cadmium (Cd) exposure during pregnancy 
      on estradiol (E(2)) and progesterone (Pg) synthesis in the ovarian granulosa 
      cells (GCs) of offspring. Pregnant SD rats were intragastrically exposed to 
      CdCl(2) (0, 0.5, 2.0, 8.0 mg/kg) from days 1 to 20 to produce the F1 generation, 
      F1 males were mated with newly purchased females to produce the F2 generation, 
      and the F3 generation was obtained in the same way. Using this model, Cd-induced 
      hormone synthesis disorders in GCs of F1 have been observed [8]. In this study, 
      altered serum E(2) and Pg levels in both F2 and F3 generations showed a 
      nonmonotonic dose‒response relationship. In addition, hormone synthesis-related 
      genes (Star, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Cyp19a1, Sf-1) and miRNAs were observed to be 
      altered in both F2 and F3. No differential changes in DNA methylation 
      modifications of hormone synthesis-related genes were observed, and only the 
      Adcy7 was hypomethylated. In summary, paternal genetic intergenerational and 
      transgenerational effects exist in ovarian GCs E(2) and Pg synthesis disorders 
      induced by Cd during pregnancy. In F2, the upregulation of StAR and CYP11A1, and 
      changes in the miR-27a-3p, miR-27b-3p, and miR-146 families may be important, 
      while changes in the miR-10b-5p and miR-146 families in F3 may be important.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Child marriage is a union before the age of 18 and a violation of 
      human right. Around 21% of young women in the world married before reaching the 
      age of 18. Every year, 10 million girls under the age of 18 are married. Child 
      marriage causes lifetime suffering, and its abolition was one component of the 
      Sustainable Development Goal to achieve gender equality and empower women and 
      girls. However; abolition of child marriage by 2030 will not happen because its 
      prevalence in the community has remained stable. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 
      prevalence of child marriage and its associated factors among reproductive-age 
      women from March 7 to April 5, 2022 in Harari Regional State, eastern Ethiopia. 
      METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 7 to 
      April 5, 2022 among the reproductive age group in the Harari Region state, 
      Eastern Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to find study 
      participants. Data were obtained by face-to-face interview using a pre-tested 
      structured questionnaire, input into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using Stata 
      version 16. The proportion with 95% confidence interval (CI) and the summery 
      measure were used to report the prevalence. A multivariable logistic regression 
      analysis model was used to examine associated factors, and the results were 
      provided as an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval. RESULT: 
      In this study 986 were responded to the interview, making response rate of 99.6%. 
      The median age of study participants was 22 years. The prevalence of child 
      marriage was 33.7% [95% CI: 30.8-36.7] in this study. Being a Muslim (AOR = 2.30, 
      95% CI = 1.26, 4.19), diploma or higher level of education (AOR = 0.26, 
      95%CI = .10, 0.70), rural residence (AOR = 5.39, 95% CI = 3.71, 7.82), a marriage 
      arranged by others (AOR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.49, 4.82) and not knowing legal age of 
      marriage (AOR = 4.49, 95% CI = 2.57, 7.85) were significantly associated with 
      child marriage. CONCLUSION: According to this report, nearly one out of every 
      three women engages in child marriage. The practice was more common among those 
      with lower educational attainment, those who lived in rural areas, people who 
      were unaware of the legal age of marriage, and those whose engagement was decided 
      by others. Focusing on strategies that allow for intervention in these factors is 
      beneficial in ending child marriage, which has a direct and indirect impact on 
      women's health and educational achievement.

AB  - Efficient evaluation of the primordial follicle pool (PFP) of mammalian models is 
      an essential subject in biomedical research relating to ovarian physiology and 
      pathogenesis. Our recent study has identified a gene signature including Sohlh1, 
      Nobox, Lhx8, Tbpl2, Stk31, Padi6, and Vrtn strongly correlated with ovarian 
      reserve by using bioinformatics analysis. Aimed to investigate the validity of 
      these candidate biomarkers for evaluating the PFP, we utilized an OR comparison 
      model to decode the relationship between the numbers of PFP and candidate 
      biomarkers in the present study. Our results suggest that these biomarkers 
      Sohlh1, Nobox, Lhx8, Tbpl2, Stk31, Padi6, and Vrtn possess independent potential 
      to evaluate the number of the PFP. And the combination of Sohlh1 and Lhx8 can be 
      used as the optimal biomarkers for rapid assessment of the PFP in the murine 
      ovary. Our findings provide a new perspective for evaluating the PFP of the ovary 
      in animal studies and the clinic.

TI  - 3D printing of foetal vascular rings: feasibility and applicability.
PG  - 355
LID - 10.1186/s12884-023-05683-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular rings (VRs) exhibit complex and diverse forms that are 
      difficult to conceptualize using traditional two-dimensional (2D) schematic. 
      Inexperienced medical students and parents who lack a medical technology 
      background face significant challenges in understanding VRs. The purpose of this 
      research is to develop three-dimensional (3D) printing models of VRs to provide 
      new technical imaging support for medical education and parental consultation. 
      METHODS: This study included 42 fetuses diagnosed as VRs. Foetal 
      echocardiography, modeling and 3D printing were performed, and the dimensional 
      accuracy of models was analyzed. The value of 3D printing in the teaching of VRs 
      was analyzed based on comparing the test results before and after the teaching 
      intervention of 48 medical students and the satisfaction survey. A brief survey 
      was conducted to 40 parents to assess the value of the 3D printed model in 
      prenatal consultations. RESULTS: Forty models of VRs were successfully obtained, 
      which reproduced the anatomical shape of the VRs space with high dimensional 
      accuracy. No differences in the prelecture test results were noted between the 3D 
      printing group and the 2D image group. After the lecture, the knowledge of both 
      groups improved, but the postlecture score and the change in the prelecture 
      versus postlecture score were greater in the 3D printing group, and the 
      subjective satisfaction survey feedback in the 3D printing group was also better 
      (P < 0.05). Similar results were observed from the parental questionnaire, the 
      vast majority of parents have an enthusiastic and positive attitude towards the 
      use of 3D printed models and suggest using them in future prenatal consultations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional printing technology providing a new tool for 
      effectively displaying different types of foetal VRs. This tool helps physicians 
      and families understand the complex structure of foetal great vessels, positively 
      impacting medical instruction and prenatal counselling.

TI  - Increasing emergency number utilisation is not driven by low-acuity calls: an 
      observational study of 1.5 million emergency calls (2018-2021) from Berlin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Emergency Medical Service (EMS) in Germany is increasingly 
      challenged by strongly rising demand. Speculations about a greater utilisation 
      for minor cases have led to intensive media coverage, but empirical evidence is 
      lacking. We investigated the development of low-acuity calls from 2018 to 2021 in 
      the federal state of Berlin and its correlations with sociodemographic 
      characteristics. METHODS: We analysed over 1.5 million call documentations 
      including medical dispatch codes, age, location and time using descriptive and 
      inferential statistics and multivariate binary logistic regression. We defined a 
      code list to classify low-acuity calls and merged the dataset with 
      sociodemographic indicators and data on population density. RESULTS: The number 
      of emergency calls (phone number 112 in Germany) increased by 9.1% from 2018 to 
      2021; however, the proportion of low-acuity calls did not increase. The 
      regression model shows higher odds of low-acuity for young to medium age groups 
      (especially for age 0-9, OR 1.50 [95% CI 1.45-1.55]; age 10-19, OR 1.77 [95% CI 
      1.71-1.83]; age 20-29, OR 1.64 [95% CI 1.59-1.68] and age 30-39, OR 1.40 [95% CI 
      1.37-1.44]; p < 0.001, reference group 80-89) and for females (OR 1.12 [95% CI 
      1.1-1.13], p < 0.001). Odds were slightly higher for calls from a neighbourhood 
      with lower social status (OR 1.01 per index unit increase [95% CI 1.0-1.01], 
      p < 0.05) and at the weekend (OR 1.02 [95% CI 1.0-1.04, p < 0.05]). No 
      significant association of the call volume with population density was detected. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides valuable new insights into pre-hospital 
      emergency care. Low-acuity calls were not the primary driver of increased EMS 
      utilisation in Berlin. Younger age is the strongest predictor for low-acuity 
      calls in the model. The association with female gender is significant, while 
      socially deprived neighbourhoods play a minor role. No statistically significant 
      differences in call volume between densely and less densely populated regions 
      were detected. The results can inform the EMS in future resource planning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delayed carpal tunnel syndrome after Colles' fracture is a common 
      complication particularly following conservative treatment. The aim of the study 
      was to verify the correlation of different radiological parameters of carpal 
      alignment and the development as well as the severity of DCTS in elderly female 
      patients within 6 months of distal radial fracture (DRF). METHODS: This is a 
      retrospective case-control study that included 60 female patients with DRF within 
      6 months treated conservatively (30 patients with signs and symptoms suggestive 
      of DCTS and 30 asymptomatic patients as a control group). Electrophysiological 
      evaluation was done for all the participants, as well as radiological assessment 
      to measure parameters of carpal alignment mainly radiocapitate distance (RCD), 
      volar prominence height (VPH) and volar tilt (VT). RESULTS: There was a 
      statistical significant difference between both groups regarding the radiological 
      parameters of carpal alignment (The mean values of RCD, VT and VPH 
      were - 11.48 mm, - 20.68° angle, and 2.24 mm respectively in the symptomatic 
      group). A strong correlation was found between decrease in the parameters of 
      carpal alignment and the severity of DCTS. Logistic regression analysis showed 
      that VT is strongly involved in the development of DCTS. The threshold value of 
      the VT was - 20.2° angle (sensitivity 0.83; specificity 0.9; odds ratio 45; 95% 
      CI 0.894-0.999; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical alteration of the carpal 
      tunnel after DRF with dorsal displacement of the carpal bones contribute to the 
      development of DCTS. Decreasing VT and VPH and RCD are the most significant 
      independent predictors for the development of DCTS in conservatively managed DRF.

TI  - Left parathyroid carcinoma with secondary hyperparathyroidism: a case report.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1186/s12902-023-01370-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare disease with a frequency of 0.005% of 
      all malignancies [1, 2]. Various aspects of its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and 
      treatment remain poorly understood. Furthermore, cases with secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism are fewer. In this case report, we describe a case of left 
      parathyroid carcinoma with secondary hyperparathyroidism. CASE PRESENTATION: The 
      patient was a 54-year-old woman who had been on hemodialysis since the age of 
      40 years. At 53 years of age, her calcium levels were high, and she was diagnosed 
      with drug-resistant secondary hyperparathyroidism and was referred to our 
      hospital for surgical treatment. Blood tests revealed calcium levels of 
      11.4 mg/dL and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels of 1007 pg/mL. Neck 
      ultrasonography revealed a 22-mm large round hypoechoic mass, partially 
      indistinct margins, and D/W ratio > 1 at the left thyroid lobe. Computed 
      tomography scans revealed a 20-mm nodule at the left thyroid lobe. No enlarged 
      lymph nodes or distant metastases were noted. 
      (99m)Tc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile scintigraphy revealed an accumulation 
      at the superior pole of the left thyroid lobe. Laryngeal endoscopy revealed 
      paralysis of the left vocal cord, signifying recurrent nerve palsy due to 
      parathyroid carcinoma. Based on these results, a diagnosis of secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism and suspected left parathyroid carcinoma was made, and the 
      patient underwent surgery. Pathology results revealed hyperplasia in the right 
      upper and lower parathyroid glands. The left upper parathyroid gland showed 
      capsular and venous invasion, and the diagnosis was left parathyroid carcinoma. 
      At 4 months post-surgery, calcium levels improved to 8.7 mg/dL and intact PTH 
      levels to 20 pg/mL, with no signs of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of 
      left parathyroid carcinoma associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism. 
      Concomitant secondary hyperparathyroidism may cause mild hypercalcemia compared 
      to parathyroid carcinoma alone due to the added modification of dialysis. 
      Although our patient also presented with mild hypercalcemia, a D/W ratio > 1 on 
      preoperative echocardiography and presence of recurrent nerve palsy on 
      laryngoscopy led to the suspicion and treatment of parathyroid carcinoma 
      preoperatively.

TI  - "It's just like a blood transfusion": perceptions on the use of donated breast 
      milk in selected hospitals in central Uganda: a qualitative study.
PG  - 901
LID - 10.1186/s12889-023-15648-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast milk is crucial for the nutritional and developmental 
      milestones in the first two years of life. Uganda has recognized the need for a 
      human milk bank as an opportunity that offers reliable and healthy milk to babies 
      who lack access to their mothers. However, there is little information on the 
      perceptions towards donated breast milk in Uganda. This study aimed to explore 
      the perceptions of mothers, fathers, and health workers on the use of donated 
      breast milk at Nsambya and Naguru hospitals in Kampala district, central Uganda. 
      METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted at Nsambya and Naguru 
      hospitals in central Uganda. The study consisted of 8 focus group discussions 
      (FGDs) of 6 participants each and 19 key informant interviews (KIIs) among 
      mothers, fathers, and health workers. Participants were purposively selected. 
      Data collected were transcribed, translated from Luganda to English, and analyzed 
      using thematic analysis. All data were organized and managed in Nvivo version 
      12.0. RESULTS: A total of 67 participants were involved in the study. Two main 
      themes were identified: positive perceptions and negative perceptions. 
      Participants linked donated breast milk to blood transfusion, believed it had 
      nutrients comparable to the biological mother's milk, and thought it was an 
      opportunity to avoid formula or cow milk and help babies that cannot access 
      breast milk. However, the notable negative perceptions were; the feeling that 
      donated breast milk is disgusting, could result in acquiring non-parental genes 
      and traits, and that it was unsafe. Participants also feared that donated breast 
      milk could be expensive and affect the bond between mother and child. CONCLUSION: 
      In summary, participants had positive perceptions about donated breast milk but 
      were concerned about the potential side effects. Health workers should take extra 
      precautions to ensure that donated breast milk is safe. The development of 
      appropriate information and communication programs to sensitize the public about 
      the benefits of donated breast milk will improve the uptake. Further research 
      should focus on understanding the social-cultural beliefs regarding donated 
      breast milk.

TI  - Late miscarriage and stillbirth in asymptomatic and symptomatic hospitalised 
      pregnant women in Belgium during the first and second waves of COVID-19: a 
      prospective nationwide population-based study.
PG  - 356
LID - 10.1186/s12884-023-05624-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stillbirth has been recognized as a possible complication of a 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, probably due to destructive placental 
      lesions (SARS-CoV-2 placentitis). The aim of this work is to analyse stillbirth 
      and late miscarriage cases in unvaccinated pregnant women infected with 
      SARS-CoV-2 during the first two waves (wild-type period) in Belgium. METHODS: 
      Stillbirths and late miscarriages in our prospective observational nationwide 
      registry of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women (n = 982) were classified by three 
      authors using a modified WHO-UMC classification system for standardized case 
      causality assessment. RESULTS: Our cohort included 982 hospitalised pregnant 
      women infected with SARS-CoV-2, with 23 fetal demises (10 late miscarriages from 
      12 to 22 weeks of gestational age and 13 stillbirths). The stillbirth rate was 
      9.5‰ for singleton pregnancies and 83.3‰ for multiple pregnancies, which seems 
      higher than for the background population (respectively 5.6‰ and 13.8‰). The 
      agreement between assessors about the causal relationship with SARS-Cov-2 
      infection was fair (global weighted kappa value of 0.66). Among these demises, 
      17.4% (4/23) were "certainly" attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 13.0% (3/23) 
      "probably" and 30.4% (7/23) "possibly". Better agreement in the rating was 
      noticed when pathological examination of the placenta and identification of the 
      virus were available, underlining the importance of a thorough investigation in 
      case of intra-uterine fetal demise. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 causality assessment 
      of late miscarriage and stillbirth cases in our Belgian nationwide case series 
      has shown that half of the fetal losses could be attributable to SARS-CoV-2. We 
      must consider in future epidemic emergencies to rigorously investigate cases of 
      intra-uterine fetal demise and to store placental tissue and other material for 
      future analyses.

TI  - Risk factors for acute postoperative hypertension in non-cardiac major surgery: a 
      case control study.

AB  - PURPOSE: Acute postoperative hypertension (APH) is a common complication during 
      the anesthesia recovery period that can lead to adverse outcomes, including 
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular accidents. Identification of risk factors for 
      APH will allow for preoperative optimization and appropriate perioperative 
      management. This study aimed to identify risk factors for APH. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, 1,178 cases were included. 
      Data was entered by two investigators, and consistency analysis was performed by 
      another. Patients were divided into APH and non-APH groups. A predictive model 
      was built by multivariate stepwise logistic regression. The predictive ability of 
      the logistic regression model was tested by drawing the receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curve and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Hosmer 
      and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit (GOF) test was performed to reflect the goodness of 
      fit of the model. Calibration curve was created to represent the relationship 
      between predicted risk and observed frequency. Sensitivity analysis was performed 
      to evaluate the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis showed that age over 65 years (OR = 3.07, 95% CI: 
      2.14 ~ 4.42, P < 0.001), female patients (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.02 ~ 1.84, 
      P = 0.034), presence of intraoperative hypertension (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 
      1.57 ~ 2.95, P < 0.001), and use of propofol in PACU (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 
      1.49 ~ 3.06, P < 0.001) were risk factors for APH. Intraoperative use of 
      dexmedetomidine (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49 ~ 0.89, P = 0.007) was a protective 
      factor. Higher baseline SBP (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.89 ~ 0.92, P < 0.001) also 
      showed some correlation with APH. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of acute postoperative 
      hypertension increased with age over 65 years, female patients, intraoperative 
      hypertension and restlessness during anesthesia recovery. Intraoperative use of 
      dexmedetomidine was a protective factor for APH.

TI  - Single cell profiling at the maternal-fetal interface reveals a deficiency of 
      PD-L1(+) non-immune cells in human spontaneous preterm labor.

AB  - The mechanisms that underlie the timing of labor in humans are largely unknown. 
      In most pregnancies, labor is initiated at term (≥ 37 weeks gestation), but in a 
      signifiicant number of women spontaneous labor occurs preterm and is associated 
      with increased perinatal mortality and morbidity. The objective of this study was 
      to characterize the cells at the maternal-fetal interface (MFI) in term and 
      preterm pregnancies in both the laboring and non-laboring state in Black women, 
      who have among the highest preterm birth rates in the U.S. Using mass cytometry 
      to obtain high-dimensional single-cell resolution, we identified 31 cell 
      populations at the MFI, including 25 immune cell types and six non-immune cell 
      types. Among the immune cells, maternal PD1(+) CD8 T cell subsets were less 
      abundant in term laboring compared to term non-laboring women. Among the 
      non-immune cells, PD-L1(+) maternal (stromal) and fetal (extravillous 
      trophoblast) cells were less abundant in preterm laboring compared to term 
      laboring women. Consistent with these observations, the expression of CD274, the 
      gene encoding PD-L1, was significantly depressed and less responsive to fetal 
      signaling molecules in cultured mesenchymal stromal cells from the decidua of 
      preterm compared to term women. Overall, these results suggest that the PD1/PD-L1 
      pathway at the MFI may perturb the delicate balance between immune tolerance and 
      rejection and contribute to the onset of spontaneous preterm labor.

AB  - Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) has been linked with body image (BI) impairment and 
      reduced quality of life (QoL). We sought to evaluate the associations between 
      Cutaneous Body Image Scale (CBIS) and disease severity in HS patients.Between 
      July 2020 and January 2022, a cross-sectional study was carried out including 
      consecutive HS patients above the age of 16 who attended a Tertiary Referral 
      Hospital in Greece. Disease Severity was graded with the Hurley stage, 
      HS-Physician's Global Assessment (HS-PGA) scale, and the Modified Sartorius scale 
      (MSS). Patients completed at their first visit ten survey instruments including 
      Patients' Severity of disease, pain and pruritus scale, CBIS, Multidimensional 
      Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ) including 5 subscales: Appearance 
      Evaluation (AE), Appearance Orientation (AO), Body Areas Satisfaction Scale 
      (BASS), Overweight Preoccupation (OWP), and Self Classified Weight (SCW) , 
      Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI), Skindex-16, EQ5D 5L, EQ- visual 
      analogue scale (VAS), PHQ9, and GAD7. In total, 70 HS patients above 16 years old 
      participated, mean [SD] age, 34.44 [11.64] years; 49/70 (70%) males and 21/70 
      (30%) females. Mean ± SD CBI, DLQI, Skindex-16 total, EQ-5D-5L, EQ VAS, PHQ9 and 
      GAD7 were 5.59 ± 1.58, 11.70 ± 8.88, 52.90 ± 27.75, 0.75 ± 0.21, 62.48 ± 21.12, 
      7.64 ± 5.56, 7.87 ± 5.23 respectively. Moderate to severe CBI dissatisfaction was 
      reported by 36/70 (51.42%) patients. CBI was correlated with appearance 
      evaluation (AE) (p < 0.01, r = 0.544), body areas satisfaction (BASS) (p < 0.01, 
      r = 0.481), and overweight preoccupation subscale (OWPS) (p < 0.01, 
      r =  - 0.267), and Skindex-16 (p < 0.01, r =  - 0.288). HS patients with affected 
      genital areas scored higher in disease patient's severity score (p = 0.015), and 
      male patients scored higher in Skindex-16 than females(p < 0.01). Our study found 
      that the mean of CBI in HS patients was 5.59 ± SD 1.58. Predictors for CBI 
      dissatisfaction were low scores of MBSRQ Appearance Evaluation (AE) and Body 
      Areas Satisfaction Subscale (BASS).

AB  - N-linked glycosylation is a critical post translational modification of 
      eukaryotic proteins. N-linked glycans are present on surface and secreted 
      filarial proteins that play a role in host parasite interactions. Examples of 
      glycosylated Brugia malayi proteins have been previously identified but there has 
      not been a systematic study of the N-linked glycoproteome of this or any other 
      filarial parasite. In this study, we applied an enhanced N-glyco FASP protocol 
      using an engineered carbohydrate-binding protein, Fbs1, to enrich N-glycosylated 
      peptides for analysis by LC-MS/MS. We then mapped the N-glycosites on proteins 
      from three host stages of the parasite: adult female, adult male and 
      microfilariae. Fbs1 enrichment of N-glycosylated peptides enhanced the 
      identification of N-glycosites. Our data identified 582 N-linked glycoproteins 
      with 1273 N-glycosites. Gene ontology and cell localization prediction of the 
      identified N-glycoproteins indicated that they were mostly membrane and 
      extracellular proteins. Comparing results from adult female worms, adult male 
      worms, and microfilariae, we find variability in N-glycosylation at the protein 
      level as well as at the individual N-glycosite level. These variations are 
      highlighted in cuticle N-glycoproteins and adult worm restricted N-glycoproteins 
      as examples of proteins at the host parasite interface that are well positioned 
      as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers.

AB  - Intestinal colonization with Klebsiella has been linked to necrotizing 
      enterocolitis (NEC), but methods of analysis usually failed to discriminate 
      Klebsiella species or strains. A novel ~ 2500-base amplicon (StrainID) that spans 
      the 16S and 23S rRNA genes was used to generate amplicon sequence variant (ASV) 
      fingerprints for Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae species complexes 
      (KoSC and KpSC, respectively) and co-occurring fecal bacterial strains from 10 
      preterm infants with NEC and 20 matched controls. Complementary approaches were 
      used to identify cytotoxin-producing isolates of KoSC. Klebsiella species 
      colonized most preterm infants, were more prevalent in NEC subjects versus 
      controls, and replaced Escherichia in NEC subjects. Single KoSC or KpSC ASV 
      fingerprinted strains dominated the gut microbiota, suggesting exclusionary 
      Klebsiella competition for luminal resources. Enterococcus faecalis was 
      co-dominant with KoSC but present infrequently with KpSC. Cytotoxin-producing 
      KoSC members were identified in most NEC subjects and were less frequent in 
      controls. Few Klebsiella strains were shared between subjects. We conclude that 
      inter-species Klebsiella competition, within an environment of KoSC and E. 
      faecalis cooperation, appears to be an important factor for the development of 
      NEC. Preterm infants seem to acquire Klebsiella primarily through routes other 
      than patient-to-patient transmission.

AB  - It has recently been demonstrated that reflex excitation of muscle sympathetic 
      nerves triggered by muscle contraction contributes to the maintenance of tetanic 
      force (TF) in rat hindlimb muscles. We hypothesized that this feedback mechanism 
      between the contraction of hindlimb muscles and the lumbar sympathetic nerves 
      declines during aging. In this study, we examined the contribution of sympathetic 
      nerves on skeletal muscle contractility in young adult (4-9 months old, n = 11) 
      and aged (32-36 months old, n = 11) male and female rats. The tibial nerve was 
      electrically stimulated to measure the TF of the triceps surae muscles resulting 
      from motor nerve activation before and after cutting or stimulating (at 5-20 Hz) 
      the lumbar sympathetic trunk (LST). The TF amplitude decreased by cutting the LST 
      in the young and aged groups; however, the magnitude of the decrease in TF 
      following transection of the LST in the aged rats (6.2%) was significantly 
      (P = 0.02) smaller compared with that in the young rats (12.9%). The TF amplitude 
      was increased by LST stimulation at ≥ 5 Hz in the young and ≥ 10 Hz in the aged 
      groups. The overall TF response to LST stimulation was not significantly 
      different between the two groups; however, an increase in muscle tonus resulting 
      from LST stimulation, independent of motor nerve stimulation, was significantly 
      (P = 0.03) greater in aged compared with young rats. The sympathetic contribution 
      to support motor nerve-induced muscle contraction declined, whereas 
      sympathetic-mediated muscle tonus, independent of motor nerve activity, was 
      augmented in aged rats. These changes in sympathetic modulation of hindlimb 
      muscle contractility may underlie the reduction of skeletal muscle strength 
      during voluntary contraction and rigidity of motion during senescence.

PG  - 2212830
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2023.2212830 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between 
      hyperuricemia and maternal and neonatal complications in pregnant women. METHODS: 
      We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from the 
      databases' inception to August 12, 2022. We included studies that reported 
      results on the association between hyperuricemia and maternal and fetal outcomes 
      among pregnant women. Using the random-effects model, the pooled odds ratio (OR) 
      with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated for each outcome analysis. 
      RESULTS: A total of 7 studies, including 8104 participants, were included. The 
      pooled OR for pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) was 2.61 [0.26, 26.56] 
      (z = 0.81, p = .4165; I(2) = 96.3%). The pooled OR for preterm birth was 2.52 
      [1.92, 3.30] (z = 6.64, p < .0001; I(2) = 0%). The pooled OR for low birth weight 
      (LBW) was 3.44 [2.52, 4.70] (z = 7.77, p < .0001; I(2) = 0%). The pooled OR for 
      small gestational age (SGA) was 1.81 [0.60, 5.46] (z = 1.06, p = .2912; I(2) = 
      88.6%). CONCLUSION: Results of this meta-analysis indicate a positive 
      relationship between hyperuricemia and PIH, preterm birth, LBW, and SGA in 
      pregnant women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe the clinical-surgical results of patients with PAS in the 
      low-posterior cervical-trigonal space associated with fibrosis (PAS type 4) 
      compared with PAS types in other locations (Types 1, upper bladder, 2 in upper 
      parametrium) and in particular with PAS type 3, corresponding to dissectible 
      cervical-trigonal invasion. The clinical-surgical results of using a standard 
      hysterectomy were analyzed with a modified subtotal hysterectomy (MSTH) in 
      patients with PAS type 4. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective, 
      multicenter study included 337 patients of PAS; thirty-two corresponding to PAS 
      type 4, from three PAS reference hospitals, CEMIC, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 
      Fundación Valle de Lili, Cali, Colombia, and Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, 
      Surabaya, Indonesia, between January 2015 and December 2020. PAS was diagnosed by 
      abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound and topographically characterized by 
      ultrafast T2 weighted MRI. In persistent macroscopic hematuria after MSTH, the 
      surgeon performs an intentional cystotomy and uses a square compression suture to 
      achieve the hemostasis inside the bladder wall.According to a PAS topographical 
      classification, the patients with low-vesical cervical involvement compared with 
      PAS located in relation with the upper blader (type1), upper parametrium (type 2 
      upper), and also with PAS situated in the lower vesical-trigon space (type 3). 
      PAS 3 and 4 are located in identical area, but in type 3, group A, the 
      vesicouterine space was dissectible, and in type 4, group B, significant fibrosis 
      made surgical dissection extremely challenging. Furthermore, group B was divided 
      into patients treated with total hysterectomy (HT) and those treated with a 
      modified subtotal hysterectomy (MSTH). The surgical requirements to perform an 
      MSHT included the availability of proximal vascular control at the aortic level 
      (internal manual aortic compression, aortic endovascular balloon, aortic loop, or 
      aortic cross-clamping). Then surgeon performed an upper segmental hysterotomy, 
      avoiding the abnormal placenta invasion area; after that, the fetus was 
      delivered, and the umbilical cord was ligated.After uterine exteriorization, the 
      surgeon applies a continuous circular suture with number 2 polyglactin 910, 
      taking some portions of the myometrium -to avoid unintentional slipping- around 
      the lower uterine segment and a 3-4 cm proximal to the abnormal adhesion of the 
      placenta. After tightening hard the circular suture, the uterine segment was 
      circumferentially cut, three centimeters proximal to the circular hemostatic 
      sutures. Next, the surgery follows the upper steps of conventional hysterectomy 
      without changes. Additionally, the histological presence of fibrosis was examined 
      in all samples. RESULTS: Modified subtotal hysterectomy in patients with PAS type 
      4 (cervical-trigonal fibrosis) resulted in a significant clínico-surgical 
      improvement over total hysterectomy. The median operative time and intraoperative 
      bleeding were 140 min (IQR 90--240) and 1895 mL (IQR 1300-2500) in patients 
      undergoing modified subtotal hysterectomy, and 260 min (IQR 210-287) and 2900 mL 
      (IQR 2150-5500) in patients treated with total hysterectomy, respectively. The 
      complication rate was 20% for MSHT and 82.3% for patients with a total 
      hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: PAS in the cervical trigonal area associated with 
      fibrosis implies a greater risk of complications due to uncontrollable bleeding 
      and organ damage. MSTH is associated with lower morbidity and difficulties in PAS 
      type 4. Prenatal or intrasurgical diagnosis is essential to plan surgical 
      alternatives to improve the results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP) variability is involved in the appraisal of 
      threat and safety, and can serve as a potential marker of psychological 
      resilience against stress. The relationship between biological rhythms of BP and 
      resilience was cross-sectionally assessed by 7-day/24-hour chronobiologic 
      screening in a rural Japanese community (Tosa), with focus on the 12-hour 
      component and the "circadian-circasemidian coupling" of systolic (S) BP. SUBJECTS 
      AND METHODS: Tosa residents (N = 239, 147 women, 23-74 years), free of 
      anti-hypertensive medication, completed 7-day/24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. 
      The circadian-circasemidian coupling was determined individually by computing the 
      difference between the circadian phase and the circasemidian morning-phase of 
      SBP. Participants were classified into three groups: those with a short coupling 
      interval of about 4.5 hours (Group A), those with an intermediate coupling 
      interval of about 6.0 hours (Group B), and those with a long coupling interval of 
      about 8.0 hours (Group C). RESULTS: Residents of Group B who showed optimal 
      circadian-circasemidian coordination had less pronounced morning and evening SBP 
      surges, as compared to residents of Group A (10.82 vs 14.29 mmHg, P < 0.0001) and 
      Group C (11.86 vs 15.21 mmHg, P < 0.0001), respectively. The incidence of morning 
      or evening SBP surge was less in Group B than in Group A (P < 0.0001) or Group C 
      (P < 0.0001). Group B residents showed highest measures of wellbeing and 
      psychological resilience, assessed by good relation with friends (P < 0.05), life 
      satisfaction (P < 0.05), and subjective happiness (P < 0.05). A disturbed 
      circadian-circasemidian coupling was associated with elevated BP, dyslipidemia, 
      arteriosclerosis and a depressive mood. CONCLUSION: The circadian-circasemidian 
      coupling of SBP could serve as a new biomarker in clinical practice to guide 
      precision medicine interventions aimed at achieving properly timed rhythms, and 
      thereby resilience and wellbeing.

AB  - Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital cardiac anomaly 
      with a prevalence of 1.17 per 1000 live births. Haemodynamically significant VSDs 
      require closure either surgical or transcatheter. We report a case of 
      transcatheter device closure of a moderate-sized perimembranous ventricular 
      septal defect (PmVSD), the first of its kind in Nigeria. The procedure was 
      performed on a 23-month-old female weighing 10 kg who had presented with a 
      history of frequent pneumonia and poor weight gain and signs of heart failure. 
      The procedure was uncomplicated, and she was discharged 24 hours after the 
      intervention. She had been followed-up two years post-procedure without 
      complications and she had achieved appreciable weight gain. This non-surgical 
      option was effective in this patient and provided the advantage of limited 
      hospitalization, accelerated recovery, and intervention without the need for 
      blood products. Such interventions should be scaled up in Nigeria and other 
      sub-Saharan African countries.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has stretched the medical resources of 
      both developed and developing countries. The global focus on COVID-19 may lead to 
      the neglect of other infectious diseases such as malaria which is still endemic 
      in many African countries. Some similarities in malaria and COVID-19 disease 
      presentations may also lead to late diagnosis of either disease which could 
      complicate the effects. Here, we present two cases of a 6-year-old child and a 
      17-year-old female who presented to a primary care facility in Ghana with a 
      clinical and microscopy-confirmed diagnosis of severe malaria complicated by 
      thrombocytopenia. As their symptoms worsened with associated respiratory 
      complications, nasopharyngeal samples were taken for real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) and tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinicians, policymakers, and public health 
      practitioners should be alert to the variety of presenting symptoms of COVID-19 
      and its similarity to malaria to mitigate the risk of mortality from either 
      disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: literature on Hashimoto´s thyroiditis, the common thyroid illness 
      in the young populations, in Sudan and Africa is scarce. We aimed to study its 
      clinical profile and outcome among Sudanese children and adolescents. METHODS: 
      records of 73 patients were reviewed. Data related to demographics, presenting 
      features, family history and coexistence of autoimmune diseases, physical 
      examination findings, and biochemical progression over time were obtained. 
      RESULTS: patients´ mean age at the diagnosis was 10.6 ± 2.9 years, 80.8% (n = 59) 
      of them were female and 83.6% (n = 61) were residing in iodine-sufficient areas. 
      The commonest presenting features were thyromegaly and fatigability (79.5%, n = 
      58 and 43.8%, n = 32, respectively) after an illness duration of 0.5-48 months. 
      Autoimmune comorbidities were documented in 8.2% (n = 6) of our series and more 
      than half (53.4%, n = 39) of them were pre-pubertal at the diagnosis. Sixty point 
      three percent (60.3%) (n = 44), 20.5% (n = 15), 13.7% (n = 10) and 5.5% (n = 4) 
      of patients presented with overt hypothyroidism, sub-clinical hypothyroidism, 
      euthyroidism and hyperthyroidism respectively, and there were no significant 
      differences in the clinical profile between them. In patients' continued 
      follow-up, 94.1% (n = 32/34) of those presented with overt hypothyroidism 
      required levothyroxine therapy to maintain euthyroidism for 0.5-13 years, while 
      85.7% (n = 6/7) of those with euthyroidism remained so for 0.5-6 years. Remission 
      was reported in all hyperthyroid patients and in only 5.9% (n = 2/34) of those 
      with overt hypothyroidism at diagnosis. The majority of our patients with 
      subclinical hypothyroidism were treated with levothyroxine and continued to be 
      euthyroid for 10 months to 13 years. CONCLUSION: goiter was the commonest 
      presenting feature of Hashimoto´s thyroiditis. The majority of patients had overt 
      or subclinical hypothyroidism and almost all of them required long-term 
      levothyroxine therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COPD is an important public health problem worldwide, and there is a 
      lack of epidemiological data on COPD in high-altitude areas in Sichuan province. 
      Thus, we aimed to investigate the prevalence, risk factors and psychological 
      status of COPD in Hongyuan County, Aba Prefecture, Sichuan Province, which is 
      located at an average altitude of 3507 meters. METHODS: The 40 years old or 
      greater permanent residents of Hongyuan County were selected by random sampling 
      method, and the lung function test and questionnaires were conducted to determine 
      the disease situation of COPD. The prevalence of COPD was compared among 
      different factors of investigation, and multivariate logistic regression analysis 
      was used for different factors to determine the independent influencing factors 
      of COPD disease. RESULTS: A total of 456 permanent residents aged 40 years or 
      older in Hongyuan County, 436 qualified for quality control, among which 53 cases 
      confirmed COPD, the total prevalence was 12.16%, among which the prevalence was 
      14.55% for men and it was 8.07% for women. There were significant differences in 
      different gender, ethnicity, age, smoking status, smoking years, educational 
      level, heating style, history of tuberculosis, and prevalence of BMI (P <0.05). 
      Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age ≥60 years (OR = 2.810, 95% 
      CI: 1.0457.557), Han Nationality (OR: 3.238, 95% CI: 1.290-8.127), the heating 
      method including biofuels (OR: 18.119, 95% CI: 4.140-79.303) and coals (OR: 
      6.973, 95% CI: 1.856-26.200), medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis (OR: 
      2.670, 95% CI: 1.278-5.578), the education level including junior high school 
      (OR: 3.336, 95% CI: 1.2259.075), high school and above (OR: 5.910, 95% CI: 
      1.796-19.450), and smoking (OR: 10.774, 95% CI: 3.622-32.051) were independent 
      risk factors for COPD disease. The prevalence of anxiety was 16.98%, and the 
      prevalence of depression was 13.2%. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COPD in 
      Hongyuan County was higher than the national level; age, ethnic group, education, 
      smoking, heating method, and history of tuberculosis are the independent 
      influencing factors of COPD in Hongyuan County. The prevalence of anxiety and 
      depression is low.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-intensity exercise (HIE), such as that in marathons and 
      triathlons, suppresses transient local and systemic immunity. Serum and salivary 
      immunoglobulin heavy constant alpha 1 (IGHA1) are major markers of 
      immunosuppression by HIE. Although much is known about the systemic 
      immunosuppressive response, little is known about its local response in the oral 
      cavity, lungs, bronchial tubes, and skin. The oral cavity allows bacteria or 
      viruses to enter the body. Saliva covers the epidermis of the oral cavity and 
      plays an important role in the local stress response by preventing infection. In 
      this study, we examined the properties of saliva secreted during the local stress 
      response for half-marathon (HM) induced IGHA1 protein expression using 
      quantitative proteomics. METHODS: The Exercise Group (ExG) (19 healthy female 
      university students) participated in a HM race. The Non-Exercise Group (NExG) (16 
      healthy female university students) did not participate in the ExG. The ExG 
      saliva samples were collected 1 h pre and 2 h and 4 h post-HM. The NExG saliva 
      samples were collected at the same time intervals. The saliva volume, protein 
      concentration, and relative IGHA1 expression were analyzed. In addition, 1 h pre 
      and 2 h post- HM saliva samples were analyzed by iTRAQ. The identified factors in 
      iTRAQ were analyzed for the ExG and the NExG using western blotting. RESULTS: We 
      identified kallikrein 1 (KLK1), immunoglobulin kappa chain (IgK), and cystatin S 
      (CST4) as suppression factors, as well as IGHA1, which has been reported to be an 
      immunological stress marker. IGHA1 (p = 0.003), KLK1 (p = 0.011), IGK (p = 
      0.002), and CST4 (p = 0.003) were suppressed 2 h post-HM compared with their 
      levels pre HM, and IGHA1 (p < 0.001), KLK1 (p = 0.004), and CST4 (p = 0.006) were 
      suppressed 4 h post-HM. There was also a positive correlation between IGHA1, IGK, 
      and CST4 levels at 2 and 4 h post-HM. In addition, KLK1 and IGK levels at 2 h 
      post-HM were positively correlated. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the 
      salivary proteome is regulated, and antimicrobial proteins are suppressed 
      post-HM. These results suggest that oral immunity was transiently suppressed 
      post-HM. The positive correlation of each protein at 2 and 4 h post-HM suggests 
      that the suppressed state was similarly regulated up to 4 h after a HM. The 
      proteins identified in this study may have applications as stress markers for 
      recreational runners and individuals who perform moderate to HIE on a regular 
      basis.

AB  - Pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a pressing global health 
      concern, particularly in low-resource settings where diagnosis and treatment rely 
      on empiric, symptoms-based guidelines such as the WHO's Integrated Management of 
      Childhood Illness (IMCI). This study details the delivery of IMCI-based health 
      care to 1,320 young infants and their mothers in a low-resource urban community 
      in Lusaka, Zambia during 2015. Our Southern Africa Mother Infant Pertussis Study 
      (SAMIPS) prospectively monitored a cohort of mother/infant pairs across infants' 
      first four months of life, recording symptoms of respiratory infection and 
      antibiotics prescriptions (predominantly penicillins), and tested nasopharyngeal 
      (NP) samples for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Bordetella pertussis. Our 
      retrospective analysis of the SAMIPS cohort found that symptoms and antibiotics 
      use were more common in infants (43% and 15.7%) than in mothers (16.6% and 8%), 
      while RSV and B. pertussis were observed at similar rates in infants (2.7% and 
      32.5%) and mothers (2% and 35.5%), albeit frequently at very low levels. In 
      infants, we observed strong associations between symptoms, pathogen detection, 
      and antibiotics use. Critically, we demonstrate that non-macrolide antibiotics 
      were commonly prescribed for pertussis infections, some of which persisted across 
      many weeks. We speculate that improved diagnostic specificity and/or clinician 
      education paired with timely, appropriate treatment of pertussis could 
      substantially reduce the burden of this disease while reducing the off-target use 
      of penicillins.

TI  - Temperament and character in an Australian sample: examining cross-sectional 
      associations of personality with age, sex, and satisfaction with life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Personality can influence how we interpret and react to our day-to-day 
      life circumstances. Temperament and character are the primary dimensions of 
      personality, and both are influenced genetically. Temperament represents our 
      emotional core, while character reflects our goals and values as we develop 
      through life. Research shows that where people live, their social, economic, and 
      physical environment can influence attitudes and behaviors, and these have links 
      to variations in personality traits. There are few studies that focus on 
      Australian personality as temperament and character. Using an Australian general 
      population sample, we examined the psychometric properties of the Temperament and 
      Character Inventory (TCIR140) and investigated the associations between TCIR140 
      traits with both sociodemographic variables and measures of well-being. In 
      addition, we investigated differences in temperament and character between our 
      Australian general population sample and published results of similar studies 
      from other countries. METHODS: Australians (N = 1,510) completed the Temperament 
      and Character Inventory (TCIR-140), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale and 
      the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Cronbach's alpha and confirmatory factor 
      analysis (CFA) examined the TCIR-140 psychometrics. Correlation analyzes, 
      independent sample t-tests and ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons analyzed the 
      sample. RESULTS: Cronbach's alphas were high, ranging from α = 0.78-0.92, and the 
      CFA confirmed two constructs of temperament and character. Females were higher in 
      Harm Avoidance (p < 0.001), Reward Dependence (p < 0.001), and Cooperativeness 
      (p < 0.001) compared to males, who were higher in Self-Directedness (p < 0.001). 
      Age groups showed significant differences among all temperament and character 
      traits (p < 0.001) except for Reward Dependence (p = 0.690). Young adults had the 
      least resilient personality profile and poorest measures of well-being. 
      Correlations with measures of temperament and character, well-being and affect 
      were all in the expected direction. CONCLUSIONS: Temperament and character are 
      related to indicators of wellbeing and differs by age and sex. This Australian 
      sample demonstrate a temperament that is high in Persistence and a character high 
      in Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness with an overall postive affect and a 
      general satisfaction with life. In comparison to other countries, Australians in 
      this sample differ in levels of several traits, demonstrating a cautious and 
      independent temperament with a character that is cooperative, industrious, and 
      self-reliant. Young-adults in comparison to older groups have a temperament and 
      character profile that is prone to negative emotions and a lower satisfaction 
      with life.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tamoxifen (TAM) has proven to be a therapeutic breakthrough to 
      reduce mortality and recurrence in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer 
      patients. However, the application of TAM exhibits low bioavailability, 
      off-target toxicity, instinct and acquired TAM resistance. METHODS: We utilized 
      black phosphorus (BP) as a drug carrier and sonosensitizer, integrated with TAM 
      and tumor-targeting ligand folic acid (FA) to construct TAM@BP-FA for synergistic 
      endocrine and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) of breast cancer. The exfoliated BP 
      nanosheets were modified through in situ polymerization of dopamine, followed by 
      electrostatic adsorption of TAM and FA. The anticancer effect of TAM@BP-FA was 
      evaluated through in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor model. 
      RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, flow 
      cytometry analysis and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) analysis were 
      performed for mechanism investigation. RESULTS: TAM@BP-FA had satisfactory drug 
      loading capacity, the TAM release behavior can be controlled through pH 
      microenvironment and ultrasonic stimulation. An amount of hydroxyl radical (∙OH) 
      and singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) were as expected generated under ultrasound 
      stimulation. TAM@BP-FA nanoplatform showed excellent internalization in both 
      TAM-sensitive MCF7 and TAM-resistant (TMR) cells. Using TMR cells, TAM@BP-FA 
      displayed significantly enhanced antitumor ability in comparison with TAM (7.7% 
      vs 69.6% viability at 5μg/mL), the additional SDT further caused 15% more cell 
      death. RNA-seq unraveled the TAM@BP-FA antitumor mechanisms including effects on 
      cell cycle, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Further analysis showed additional 
      SDT successfully triggering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and 
      mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) reduction. Moreover, PBMCs exposed to 
      TAM@BP-FA induced an antitumor immune response by natural killer (NK) cell 
      upregulation and immunosuppression macrophage reduction. CONCLUSION: The novel 
      BP-based strategy not only delivers TAM specifically to tumor cells but also 
      exhibits satisfactory antitumor effects through targeted therapy, SDT, and immune 
      cell modulation. The nanoplatform may provide a superior synergistic strategy for 
      breast cancer therapy.

TI  - Burden of cardiometabolic risk factors and preclinical target organ damage among 
      adults in Freetown, Sierra Leone: a community-based health-screening survey.
PG  - e067643
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-067643 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs), 
      target organ damage (TOD) and its associated factors among adults in Freetown, 
      Sierra Leone. DESIGN: This community-based cross-sectional study used a 
      stratified multistage random sampling method to recruit adult participants. 
      SETTING: The health screening study was conducted between October 2019 and 
      October 2021 in Western Area Urban, Sierra Leone. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2394 
      adult Sierra Leoneans aged 20 years or older were enrolled. OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Anthropometric data, fasting lipid profiles, fasting plasma glucose, TOD, 
      clinical profiles and demographic characteristics of participants were described. 
      The cardiometabolic risks were further related to TOD. RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      known CMRFs was 35.3% for hypertension, 8.3% for diabetes mellitus, 21.1% for 
      dyslipidaemia, 10.0% for obesity, 13.4% for smoking and 37.9% for alcohol. 
      Additionally, 16.1% had left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by ECG, 14.2% had LVH 
      by two-dimensional echo and 11.4% had chronic kidney disease (CKD). The odds of 
      developing ECG-LVH were higher with diabetes (OR=1.255, 95% CI (0.822 to 1.916) 
      and dyslipidaemia (OR=1.449, 95% CI (0.834 to 2.518). Associated factors for 
      higher odds of Left Ventricular Mass Index by echo were dyslipidaemia (OR=1.844, 
      95% CI (1.006 to 3.380)) and diabetes mellitus (OR=1.176, 95% CI (0.759 to 
      1.823)). The odds of having CKD were associated with diabetes mellitus (OR=1.212, 
      95% CI (0.741 to 1.983)) and hypertension (OR=1.163, 95% CI (0.887 to 1.525)). A 
      low optimal cut-off point for ECG-LVH (male 24.5 mm vs female 27.5 mm) was 
      required to maximise sensitivity and specificity by a receiver operating 
      characteristics curve since the odds for LVH by ECG were low. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study provides novel data-driven information on the burden of CMRF and its 
      association with preclinical TOD in a resource-limited setting. It illustrates 
      the need for interventions in improving cardiometabolic health screening and 
      management in Sierra Leonean.

TI  - Contextually appropriate communication strategies for COVID-19 prevention in 
      Kenya border regions: evidence from a mixed methods observational study in Busia 
      and Mandera counties.
PG  - e062686
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062686 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Kenya has long and porous borders with its neighbouring countries. 
      These regions, predominantly inhabited by highly mobile rural communities with 
      strong cross-border cultural ties, present major challenges in managing movement 
      of people and COVID-19 preventive measures. Our study sought to assess knowledge 
      of COVID-19 prevention behaviours, how these varied by socioeconomic (SEC) 
      factors and the challenges of engagement and implementation, in two border 
      counties of Kenya. METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods study using a household 
      e-survey (Busia, N=294; Mandera, N=288; 57% females, 43% males), and qualitative 
      telephone interviews (N=73: Busia 55; Mandera 18) with policy actors, healthcare 
      workers, truckers and traders, and community members. Interviews were 
      transcribed, English translated and analysed using the framework method. 
      Associations between SEC (wealth quintiles, educational level) and knowledge of 
      COVID-19 preventive behaviours were explored using Poisson regression. RESULTS: 
      Participants were mostly educated to primary school level (54.4% Busia, 61.6% 
      Mandera). Knowledge of COVID-19 prevention varied by behaviour: hand 
      washing-86.5%, use of hand sanitiser-74.8%, wearing a face mask-63.1%, covering 
      the mouth when sneezing or coughing-56.3% and social distancing-40.1%. 
      Differences in knowledge by area, educational level and the wealth index were 
      marked, greatest for Mandera, the less educated and the poor. Interviews with 
      stakeholders revealed challenges in health messaging, psychosocial and 
      socioeconomic factors, lack of preparedness for truck border crossings, language 
      barrier, denial and livelihood insecurity as key challenges to engagement with 
      and implementation of COVID-19 prevention behaviours in the border regions. 
      CONCLUSION: The influence of SEC disparities and border dynamics on knowledge and 
      engagement with COVID-19 prevention behaviours calls for contextually appropriate 
      risk communication strategies that are cognisant of community needs and local 
      patterns of information flow. Coordinating response measures across border points 
      is crucial in winning communities' trust and maintaining essential economic and 
      social activities.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of locomotive syndrome categorised by the 25-question 
      Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale: a systematic review.
PG  - e068645
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-068645 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compile the currently available 
      evidence on the clinical characteristics of the locomotive syndrome (LS) 
      categorised by the 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale (GLFS-25) and 
      clarify its clinical usefulness for assessing mobility function. DESIGN: 
      Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for 
      the relevant studies on 20 March 2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included relevant 
      peer-reviewed articles, available in English language, on clinical LS 
      characteristics categorised with the GLFS-25. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: 
      Pooled ORs or mean differences (MDs) of the LS groups were calculated and 
      compared with the non-LS groups for each clinical characteristic. RESULTS: In 
      total, 27 studies that involve 13 281 participants (LS, n=3385; non-LS, n=9896) 
      were examined in this analysis. Older age (MD 4.71; 95% (CI) 3.97 to 5.44; 
      p<0.00001), female gender (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.71; p<0.00001), higher body 
      mass index (MD 0.78; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99; p<0.00001), osteoporosis (OR 1.68; 
      95% CI 1.32 to 2.13; p<0.0001), depression (OR 3.14; 95% CI 1.81 to 5.44; 
      p<0.0001), lower lumbar lordosis angle (MD -7.91; 95% CI -10.08 to -5.74; 
      p<0.00001), higher spinal inclination angle (MD 2.70; 95% CI 1.76 to 3.65; 
      p<0.00001), lower grip strength (MD -4.04; 95% CI -5.25 to -2.83; p<0.00001), 
      lower back muscle strength (MD -15.32; 95% CI -23.83 to -6.81; p=0.0004), lower 
      maximum stride (MD -19.36; 95% CI -23.25 to -15.47; p<0.00001), higher timed 
      up-and-go (MD 1.36; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.79; p<0.00001), lower one-leg standing time 
      (MD -19.13; 95% CI -23.29 to -14.97; p<0.0001) and slower normal gait speed (MD 
      -0.20; 95% CI -0.22 to -0.18; p<0.0001) were found to be associated with LS. No 
      significant differences were noted in other clinical characteristics between the 
      two groups. CONCLUSIONS: GLFS-25 is clinically useful for assessing mobility 
      function according to the evidence available on the clinical characteristics of 
      LS categorised by the GLFS-25 questionnaire items until.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess benefits and harms arising from increasing gestational 
      diabetes (GDM) diagnosis, including for women with normal-sized babies. DESIGN, 
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Diagnosis rates, outcomes, interventions and medication 
      use are compared in a retrospective cohort study of 229 757 women birthing in 
      public hospitals of the Australian State of Queensland during two periods, 
      2011-2013 and 2016-2018, using data from the Queensland Perinatal Data 
      Collection. OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparisons include hypertensive disorders, 
      caesarean section, shoulder dystocia and associated harm, induction of labour 
      (IOL), planned birth (PB), early planned birth <39 weeks (EPB), spontaneous 
      labour onset with vaginal birth (SLVB) and medication use. RESULTS: GDM diagnosis 
      increased from 7.8% to 14.3%. There was no improvement in shoulder dystocia 
      associated injuries, hypertensive disorders or caesarean sections. There was an 
      increase in IOL (21.8%-30.0%; p<0.001), PB (36.3% to 46.0%; p<0.001) and EPB 
      (13.5%-20.6%; p<0.001), and a decrease in SLVB (56.0%-47.3%; p<0.001). Women with 
      GDM experienced an increase in IOL (40.9%-49.8%; p<0.001), PB (62.9% to 71.8%; 
      p<0.001) and EPB (35.3%-45.7%; p<0.001), and a decrease in SLVB (30.01%-23.6%; 
      p<0.001), with similar changes for mothers with normal-sized babies. Of women 
      prescribed insulin in 2016-2018, 60.4% experienced IOL, 88.5% PB, 76.4% EPB and 
      8.0% SLVB. Medication use increased from 41.2% to 49.4% in women with GDM, from 
      3.2% to 7.1% in the antenatal population overall, from 3.3% to 7.5% in women with 
      normal-sized babies and from 2.21% to 4.38% with babies less than the 10th 
      percentile. CONCLUSION: Outcomes were not apparently improved with increased GDM 
      diagnosis. The merits of increased IOL or decreased SLVB depend on the views of 
      individual women, but categorising more pregnancies as abnormal, and exposing 
      more babies to the potential effects of early birth, medication effects and 
      growth limitation may be harmful.

AB  - Tongue necrosis is a rare clinical finding because of its rich vascularisation. 
      Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most frequent cause of it, and when present, it 
      is usually one side affected. We describe a patient with several months of 
      constitutional syndrome; during that period, she develops headache followed by 
      tongue necrosis, which lead to clinical suspicion of GCA, later confirmed by a 
      temporal artery biopsy. Before the biopsy, she was treated with corticosteroids. 
      We discuss this illness and tongue necrosis as a rare manifestation to consider.

TI  - Prevalence, severity and risk factors for asthma in school-going adolescents in 
      KwaZulu Natal, South Africa.
LID - e001498 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bmjresp-2022-001498 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma remains highly prevalent, with more severe symptoms in 
      low-income to middle-income countries (LMICs) compared with high-income 
      countries. Identifying risk factors for severe asthma symptoms can assist with 
      improving outcomes. We aimed to determine the prevalence, severity and risk 
      factors for asthma in adolescents in an LMIC. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey 
      using the Global Asthma Network written and video questionnaires was conducted in 
      adolescents aged 13 and 14 from randomly selected schools in Durban, South 
      Africa, between May 2019 and June 2021. RESULTS: A total of 3957 adolescents 
      (51.9% female) were included. The prevalence of lifetime, current and severe 
      asthma was 24.6%, 13.7% and 9.1%, respectively. Of those with current and severe 
      asthma symptoms; 38.9% (n=211/543) and 40.7% (n=147/361) had doctor-diagnosed 
      asthma; of these, 72.0% (n=152/211) and 70.7% (n=104/147), respectively, reported 
      using inhaled medication in the last 12 months. Short-acting beta agonists 
      (80.4%) were more commonly used than inhaled corticosteroids (13.7%). Severe 
      asthma was associated with: fee-paying school quintile (adjusted OR (CI)): 1.78 
      (1.27 to 2.48), overweight (1.60 (1.15 to 2.22)), exposure to traffic pollution 
      (1.42 (1.11 to 1.82)), tobacco smoking (2.06 (1.15 to 3.68)), rhinoconjunctivitis 
      (3.62 (2.80 to 4.67)) and eczema (2.24 (1.59 to 3.14)), all p<0.01. CONCLUSION: 
      Asthma prevalence in this population (13.7%) is higher than the global average 
      (10.4%). Although common, severe asthma symptoms are underdiagnosed and 
      associated with atopy, environmental and lifestyle factors. Equitable access to 
      affordable essential controller inhaled medicines addressing the disproportionate 
      burden of asthma is needed in this setting.

TI  - Effect of early directed implementation of family-integrated care measures on 
      colonisation with Enterobacteriaceae in preterm neonates in NICU.
LID - e001712 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001712 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired strains (HASs) and multiresistant strains in 
      neonatal intensive care unit often harbour virulence and resistance mechanisms, 
      carrying the risk of invasive infections. We describe colonisation with 
      Enterobacteriaceae in neonates receiving early directed versus routine 
      family-integrated care (FIC) within the first month of life. METHODS: A 
      prospective cohort study included neonates with a gestational age below 34 weeks. 
      During the first period, neonates were admitted to an open bay unit with transfer 
      to the single-family room if available; feeding with the mother's own breast milk 
      (MOBM) was introduced within 24 hours, and skin-to-skin contact (SSC) within 
      5 days of life (the routine care group). During the second period, following a 
      wash-in of 2 months, care in a single-family room within 48 hours, the 
      introduction of MOBM within two and SSC in 48 hours were applied (the 
      intervention group). Enterobacteriaceae isolated from neonatal stool, breast milk 
      and parental skin swabs were genotyped, Simpson's Index of Diversity (SID) 
      calculated, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) detected. RESULTS: In 64 
      neonate-parents' groups, 176 Enterobacteriaceae, 87 in routine care and 89 in the 
      intervention group were isolated; 26 vs 18 were HAS and one vs three ESBL 
      positive, respectively. In the intervention group compared with the routine care 
      group, SSC and MOBM feeding was started significantly earlier (p<0.001); during 
      the first week of life, time spent in SSC was longer (median hours per day 4.8 
      (4-5.1) vs 1.9 (1.4-2.6), p<0.001) and the proportion of MOBM in enteral feeds 
      was higher (median (IQR) 97.8% (95.1-100) vs 95.1% (87.2-97.4), p=0.011). 
      Compared with the routine care group, the intervention group had higher SID and a 
      reduction of HAS by 33.1% (95% CI 24.4% to 42.4%) in time series analysis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Early implementation of FIC measures may hold the potential to 
      increase diversity and reduce colonisation with HAS Enterobacteriaceae.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris 
      in adult women. DESIGN: Pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised 
      controlled trial. SETTING: Primary and secondary healthcare, and advertising in 
      the community and on social media in England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS: Women (≥18 
      years) with facial acne for at least six months, judged to warrant oral 
      antibiotics. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either 
      50 mg/day spironolactone or matched placebo until week six, increasing to 100 
      mg/day spironolactone or placebo until week 24. Participants could continue using 
      topical treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was Acne-Specific 
      Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) symptom subscale score at week 12 (range 0-30, where 
      higher scores reflect improved QoL). Secondary outcomes were Acne-QoL at week 24, 
      participant self-assessed improvement; investigator's global assessment (IGA) for 
      treatment success; and adverse reactions. RESULTS: From 5 June 2019 to 31 August 
      2021, 1267 women were assessed for eligibility, 410 were randomly assigned to the 
      intervention (n=201) or control group (n=209) and 342 were included in the 
      primary analysis (n=176 in the intervention group and n=166 in the control 
      group). Baseline mean age was 29.2 years (standard deviation 7.2), 28 (7%) of 389 
      were from ethnicities other than white, with 46% mild, 40% moderate, and 13% 
      severe acne. Mean Acne-QoL symptom scores at baseline were 13.2 (standard 
      deviation 4.9) and at week 12 were 19.2 (6.1) for spironolactone and 12.9 (4.5) 
      and 17.8 (5.6) for placebo (difference favouring spironolactone 1.27 (95% 
      confidence interval 0.07 to 2.46), adjusted for baseline variables). Scores at 
      week 24 were 21.2 (5.9) for spironolactone and 17.4 (5.8) for placebo (difference 
      3.45 (95% confidence interval 2.16 to 4.75), adjusted). More participants in the 
      spironolactone group reported acne improvement than in the placebo group: no 
      significant difference was reported at week 12 (72% v 68%, odds ratio 1.16 (95% 
      confidence interval 0.70 to 1.91)) but significant difference was noted at week 
      24 (82% v 63%, 2.72 (1.50 to 4.93)). Treatment success (IGA classified) at week 
      12 was 31 (19%) of 168 given spironolactone and nine (6%) of 160 given placebo 
      (5.18 (2.18 to 12.28)). Adverse reactions were slightly more common in the 
      spironolactone group with more headaches reported (20% v 12%; p=0.02). No serious 
      adverse reactions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone improved outcomes 
      compared with placebo, with greater differences at week 24 than week 12. 
      Spironolactone is a useful alternative to oral antibiotics for women with acne.

AB  - Phenotypes are partly shaped by the environment, which can impact both short-term 
      adaptation and long-term evolution. In dioecious species, the two sexes may 
      exhibit different degrees of phenotypic plasticity and theoretical models 
      indicate that such differences may confer an adaptive advantage when the 
      population is subject to directional selection, either because of a 
      systematically varying environment or a load of deleterious mutations. The effect 
      stems from the fundamental asymmetry between the two sexes: female fertility is 
      more limited than male fertility. Whether this asymmetry is sufficient for sexual 
      dimorphism in phenotypic plasticity to evolve is, however, not obvious. Here, we 
      show that even in conditions where it provides an adaptive advantage, dimorphic 
      phenotypic plasticity may be evolutionarily unstable due to sexual selection. 
      This is the case, in particular, for panmictic populations where mating 
      partnerships are formed at random. However, we show that the effects of sexual 
      selection can be counteracted when mating occurs within groups of related 
      individuals. Under this condition, sexual dimorphism in phenotypic plasticity can 
      not only evolve but offset the twofold cost of males. We demonstrate these points 
      with a simple mathematical model through a combination of analytical and 
      numerical results.

TI  - Combined Effect of Dynapenia and Abdominal Obesity on the Prevalence of 
      Peripheral Artery Disease in Older Adults Over 75 Years Old in China.
PG  - 10760296231169503
LID - 10.1177/10760296231169503 [doi]
AB  - The objective is to examine the separate and joint effects of dynapenia and 
      abdominal obesity on the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in older 
      adults of different ages (60-74 and over 75 years old). This study comprised 1293 
      community-dwelling Chinese participants recruited from Shanghai, China, who were 
      aged at least 60 years (753 women; mean age: 72.0 ± 5.9 years). Dynapenia was 
      defined as low-grip strength (<28.0 kg for males and <18.0 kg for females) but 
      normal skeletal muscle index (≥7.0 kg/m(2) for males and ≥5.7 kg/m(2) for 
      females). Abdominal obesity was determined according to waist circumference 
      (≥90 cm for males and ≥85 cm for females), and PAD was diagnosed by an 
      ankle-brachial index  ≤ 0.9. Binary logistic regression models were performed to 
      determine associations between dynapenia, abdominal obesity, and the combination 
      of dynapenia and abdominal obesity and PAD. According to dynapenia and abdominal 
      obesity status stratified by age (60-74 or over 75), the patients were divided 
      into 4 groups: normal, dynapenia alone, abdominal obesity alone, and co-occurring 
      groups. A logistic regression showed that the co-occurring groups (odds 
      ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval = 1.41-15.21) had a higher prevalence of 
      PAD than the normal group after adjusting for the covariates in older adults over 
      75 years of age. The combination of dynapenia and abdominal obesity increase the 
      prevalence of PAD in older adults over 75 years. The present findings have 
      important implications for the early identification of older adults with PAD and 
      appropriate interventions should be implemented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: After COVID-19 infection, individuals can experience a variety of 
      symptoms that might require further treatment. Early data showed the value of 
      adapted pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and technology-based interventions. 
      To develop appropriate services, it is important to understand the symptom burden 
      and the preferred mode of rehabilitation delivery. METHODS: Post-hospital 
      discharge (H) and post-community-managed (C) individuals received a follow-up 
      call. A survey was completed to assess the most burdensome symptoms for which the 
      patients would require support and their preference for the mode of 
      rehabilitation delivery. RESULTS: Overall, 160 individuals who received a 
      follow-up call completed the survey (51.2% male, mean [SD] age 54 [15] years) and 
      126 (78.8%) were post-hospital, while 34 (21.3%) had community-managed 
      infections. A total of 101 (63.1%) reported that COVID-19-related symptoms were 
      affecting their daily activities, and 106 (66.3%) reported their desire to be 
      more active. The most common symptoms identified as needing support were fatigue 
      and shortness of breath. Both groups expressed a preference for a face-to-face 
      group programme (C: 54.8%; H: 46.8%), while (38.7%) of post-community-managed 
      individuals and (40.3%) post-hospital patients preferred a supported digital 
      rehabilitation programme. Few opted a non-digital home-based programme (C: 3.2%; 
      H:12.9%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The survey responses indicated a significant 
      symptom burden that may benefit from an intervention such as rehabilitation. 
      Preferences for rehabilitation indicated that a face-to-face intervention was 
      preferred by the majority, with a large proportion preferring digital 
      intervention.

TI  - Long-term risks of cardiovascular death in a population-based cohort of 1,141,675 
      older patients with cancer.
LID - afad068 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afad068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: previous studies have focused on the risk of cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD)-related death in individual cancers, adolescents or all cancers. OBJECTIVE: 
      to evaluate the risk of CVD-related death in older patients with cancer. METHODS: 
      older patients with cancer (over 65 years) of 16 cancers diagnosed between 1975 
      and 2018 were screened out from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results 
      program. The proportion of deaths, competing risk regression models, standardized 
      mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were used to assess the 
      risk of CVD-related death. RESULTS: this study included 1,141,675 older patients 
      (median follow-up: 13.5 years). Of the 16 individual cancers, the risk of CVD 
      death exceeded primary neoplasm death in older patients with cancers of the 
      breast, endometrium, vulva, prostate gland, penis and melanoma of the skin over 
      time (high competing risk group). Compared to the general older population, older 
      patients with cancer had higher SMR and AER of CVD-related death (SMR: 1.58-4.23; 
      AER: 21.16-365.89), heart disease-related death (SMR: 1.14-4.16; AER: 
      16.29-301.68) and cerebrovascular disease-related death (SMR: 1.11-4.66; AER: 
      3.02-72.43), with the SMR trend varying with CVD-related death competing risk 
      classifications. The risk of CVD-related death in the high-competing risk group 
      was higher than in the low-competing risk group. CONCLUSIONS: for older patients 
      with cancer, six of 16 individual cancers, including breast, endometrium, vulva, 
      prostate gland, penis and melanoma of the skin was at high risk of CVD-related 
      death. Management for long-term cardiovascular risk in older patients with cancer 
      is needed.
